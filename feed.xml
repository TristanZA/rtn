                <p class="p1"><strong>Water is a scarce and precious commodity, and access to reliable and clean source is a basic human right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, many communities around South Africa must do without this essential resource.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">For this reason, Volvo Trucks South Africa has donated two FMX trucks to the SOS Water on Wheels project in the Western Cape, to bring water and sanitation right to communities’ doorsteps.</p>
<p class="p3">SOS NPO supports under-privileged communities and schools within the water and sanitation hygiene space (WASH).  </p>
<p>They collaborate with community stakeholders, government, and businesses to provide additional water, sanitation and hygiene sources and solutions, as well as providing non-portable water, transportation, and infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p4"><strong>Related: </strong><a href="https://roadtransport.news/motus-isuzu-supports-farmers/">Motus Isuzu Supports Farmers</a></p>
<p class="p3">It addresses sanitation, hygiene, climate change and education around these issues.</p>
<p>We also focus on economic female empowerment and create local job opportunities wherever possible within our on-site project teams. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">For this reason, two female drivers have been appointed by SOS NPO to operate the vehicles, and they will undergo an extensive four-month driver training through Volvo Trucks’ Iron Women programme.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Volvo Trucks have been involved with the SOS project since 2018, and the two trucks transport water, food and materials needed to schools and communities around the Western Cape.</p>

<p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the project has expanded to provide essential sanitation stations to curb the spread of the virus in areas where it was most needed.</p>
<p class="p1">“We are very humbled that, with the support of Volvo Group global, we are now able to donate these vehicles to SOS," says Marcus Hörberg, vice president of Volvo Group Southern Africa.</p>
<p>"We trust that reliable transport will continue to make a tangible difference in the efforts of this very worthy organisation.” </p>
<p>“At Volvo Trucks we believe that transport can drive prosperity, and we feel grateful that our trucks can impact the lives of many in this way.”</p>
<p class="p1">The donation of the vehicles also includes a two-year Blue service contract.</p>
<p>Many of SOS NPO’s project sites are located close to the Volvo Trucks branch in Cape Town, which makes it ideal for the team to provide support when needed.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“The news of the donation was the best we could wish for,” said Shelley Humphreys, executive director of SOS NPO. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“We value our partnership with Volvo Trucks and the Water on Wheels project is truly an example to inspire others.”</span></p>

                <p><strong>The drought in South Africa has threatened the livelihood of many farmers but Motus Isuzu, in partnership with Isuzu South Africa and various farming assistance programmes, are working together to ease this burden.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motus Isuzu Franchise managing director, Le Roux Roux, is well acquainted with the plight of the agricultural sector and believes that if farmers cannot produce, the country will be in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The farmers are in desperate need. They have no money for food or to even send their children to school,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While Mpumalanga and the Free State received good rain and farmers expected a good harvest, several farmers in northern Limpopo had to slaughter their animals because of the drought. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The situation in the Northern and Eastern Cape provinces is equally dire,” adds Roux.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isuzu SA donated three brand-new FVZ 1400 trucks to this initiative and Motus SA have provided the drivers and the fuel for all these trips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since November, the trucks have been doing trips on an almost weekly basis, collecting feed in areas that have had good rainfall and transporting it across the country to the areas in need, often covering vast distances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organisations such as Farmers Assist and Voer ‘n Boer handle the donations of feed and identify the areas in need and Motus Isuzu ensure that these large loads are delivered where they are most needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date the three trucks have collected and distributed feed in many areas across the country, including Merweville, Vanwyksvlei, Somerset East, Upington and Pofadder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The investment in this project is substantial but it is worth it when you see the look of relief on the farmers' faces.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The effect that these deliveries have on the farmers is enormous and often means respite for their staff and the entire community,” said Roux.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feed delivery initiative involves staff at all of the Motus Isuzu dealerships.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff members from the closest dealership are our contact with the farmer and are present during collection or delivery of feed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are trying to survive the worst drought ever. There’s no more natural vegetation left on the farm, we are dependent on these fodder donations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The feed is expensive, and due to our remote location, the delivery costs are extremely high; these donations that we are receiving are worth gold,” says Charles Muller, who has been a farmer in Merweville for the past 46 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am proud to be part of this initiative. As we drive across the country, cars flash their lights to show that they appreciate what we are doing to help the farmers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that we are setting a great example for the rest of South Africa, showing what can be achieved if we work together,” states David Xaba, truck driver from Motus Isuzu Isando.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gishma Johnson, Isuzu SA Corporate Communications Manager said that one of the company’s corporate social responsibility objectives is to help communities in crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finding the right partners to get the job done is so important and demonstrated just how much can be accomplished when you work together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Farmers Assist SA approached Isuzu for assistance earlier this year, we reached out to our dealer network to garner support and are very pleased that Motus Isuzu Isando stepped up to this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motus Isuzu has four dealerships located in Isando, Vereeniging, Kimberley and Bloemfontein. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These dealerships are located near the main arteries of South Africa, including the N1, N12 and N3 and allows Motus Isuzu to best service their customers travelling these routes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Bloemfontein and Kimberley dealerships are well situated near the farming communities and service a large geographical area from their central location.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Motus Isuzu are in the process of setting up a new dealership in the North of Pretoria, on Sefako Makgatho Drive, which will allow the group to better service their customers in this area as well as those travelling north on the N1,” said Roux.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Motus Isuzu really sees this as a way of giving back to the farmers, apart from being great supporters of the Isuzu brand, the South African farming community are the back-bone of our country,” concluded Roux.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a product perspective, the next few months are exciting times for Isuzu with the arrival of the new M-UX later this year, while the new D-Max bakkie, which will be built in Port Elizabeth, will go on sale early in 2022.</span></p>

                <p><strong>JAC Motors says it has maintained its market growth since its market inception in 2017 and consistently grew sales over this period.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Establishing and growing the JAC Motors brand in South Africa has been extremely rewarding," says Karl-Heinz Göbel, CEO of JAC Motors South Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From local customer acceptance of our product range to the global introduction of the company's new N55EV electric truck, this characterise the makings of a successful automotive brand.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/photos-3_880x500.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/responsive/photos-3_880x500-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/responsive/photos-3_880x500-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/responsive/photos-3_880x500-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/responsive/photos-3_880x500-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/responsive/photos-3_880x500-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/responsive/photos-3_880x500-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="JAC truck" width="800" height="565"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The innovative, newly-launched N55EV is a thoroughly tested electric truck from JAC Motors, fitted with its latest onboard EV technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is safe, reliable, comfortable, and economical and regarded as the perfect light truck option for logistic businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAC Motors' commercial range of trucks starts with the X200 single and double-cab derivatives, fitted with 2.8-litre turbocharged diesel engines and load capacities of more than 1 000kg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an entry-level price-point of under R300 000 for the X200 single-cab, the good news for prospective owners is that this product is also available in tipper format, further increasing the versatility of this reliable hard worker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our reliable 1.5-tonne X200 single-cab for small operators such as electricians and our 1.3-tonne double-cab workhorse that can safely transport workers to and from construction sites, are real favourites with entrepreneurs and big fleet owners," says Göbel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The N-series range of trucks on offer by JAC Motors locally comprises four different derivatives with loading capacities varying from three to six tonne, with entry-level pricing of under R330 000 for the N56 3-tonne truck. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 3-tonne truck series features the company's highly efficient 2.8-litre turbo-diesel engine, and the 6-tonne truck is fitted with a durable, proven 3.8-litre Cummins turbo-diesel engine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 6-tonne truck without the load bin is priced under R500 000 (VAT incl.), making it a strong contender in its category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JAC Motors' five-year manufacturer's warranty and three-year service plan for the 3-tonne trucks are standard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A two-year/unlimited-kilometre manufacturer's warranty is available to owners of the 6-tonne trucks.</span></p>

                <p><strong>Distributed by Babcock in southern Africa, the latest DAF XF and DAF CF trucks are finally hitting South Africa’s highways - four years after their European launch.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, the DAF XF was chosen as the <a href="http://www.truck-of-the-year.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Truck of the Year</a> back in 2018.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically engineered for local road conditions, the latest DAF trucks offer pure excellence in transport efficiency while setting new benchmarks for driver comfort and safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sporting a striking and polished new look, DAF CF and DAF XF series trucks deliver outstanding productivity in even the toughest conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They now have higher torque, optimised drivelines, high-efficiency rear axles, and enhanced electronics performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new aerodynamic design completes the package and contributes to overall market-leading fuel efficiency.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-gavin-39370934/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Gavin</a>, sales director for Transport Solutions at Babcock, emphasises that the new DAF Trucks are not merely upgrades or facelifts of previous models, but are completely new vehicles, showcasing improved chassis, cabs, gearboxes and engines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our new DAF CF and DAF XF models are smart, efficient and profitable, setting higher standards for transport safety and productivity,” says Gavin. </span></p>

<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VS6RHblErg?list=PLnKwfY95HmIwDmTTE-v88glXtE5MOFf8g" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Significant savings for long distance operators</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides a fresh exterior design featuring excellent aerodynamics, central to the new trucks’ transport efficiency is a multi-torque PACCAR MX-13 engine offering more torque at lower revolutions per minute (rpm) for higher fuel efficiency and lower noise levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The low rpm also reduces CO₂ emissions, while the trucks’ Eco Performance Mode ensures an optimal balance between high drivability and best fuel efficiency. </span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gavin says local tests carried out on the new DAF trucks in South Africa have shown an average 10% reduction in fuel costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This means significant savings for long distance operators where up to 60% of overall expenses are allocated to fuel consumption,” comments Gavin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that operators can also expect to see a reduction in maintenance costs on the new DAF CF and XF trucks, thanks to environment-specific technological adaptations at DAF Trucks Eindhoven’s manufacturing facility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These include modifications to the air intake and filtration, cooling system, suspension and transmission, as well as a new high-efficiency rear axle with low-friction wheel ends and a range of faster ratios, enabling even lower engine rpm’s for greater fuel efficiency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supplied standard with both the DAF CF and DAF XF, the latest generation TraXon automated gearbox offers less friction losses, faster upshifts, and the extended use of EcoRoll contributing to lower fuel consumption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gearbox also provides specific software settings for long haulage, liquid transport, heavy duty and off road applications. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ability to set separate transmission settings for trucks which have to change speed frequently during their daily operation contributes to exceptional vehicle efficiency as well as driver comfort,” says Gavin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other engine innovations enhancing fuel economy and performance include fully variable oil, steering pumps; a new piston ring package and skirt profile; and a new turbocharger and combustion system.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>It’s all about the driver</strong></span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="DAF interior" width="800" height="534"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to driver comfort and safety is the new DAF cab, with the DAF XF offering the largest interior space on the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the DAF CF and DAF XF truck cabs feature new temperature and climate controls to improve driver comfort, as well as best-in-class interior lighting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanded driver information enables operators to respond to hazards quicker and includes intelligent tips for economical driving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new DAF XF packs in further enhanced features that not only safeguard the driver and other road users, but also contribute to vehicle versatility, fuel efficiency and comfort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) to automatically adjusts the truck’s speed and maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS) to slow the vehicle down in an emergency</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forward Collision Warning (FCW) using sound and visuals to warn the driver and help prevent a collision</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) to deter drivers from swerving out a lane as a result of drowsiness or distraction</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front and rear cab crumple zones for industry-leading vehicle safety and passenger protection</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) to minimise the risk of jack-knifing and overturning.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An exciting aspect of the new DAF CF and DAF XF trucks is that they are also equipped for the future fitment of predictive cruise control (PCC) which can determine the terrain the truck is negotiating and automatically adjust gears accordingly,” explains Gavin.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/Image_DAF-interior_sleeper-cab.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-interior_sleeper-cab-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-interior_sleeper-cab-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-interior_sleeper-cab-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-interior_sleeper-cab-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-interior_sleeper-cab-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-interior_sleeper-cab-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="DAF sleeper cab" width="800" height="534"></figure>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Total transport solutions from Babcock</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Babcock is fully geared up to provide total transport solutions for the new DAF XF and DAF CF. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gavin says that part of the unlimited mileage warranty on the DAF XF range are a number of various maintenance packages which can be tailor-made to suit all applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, all vehicles are fitted as standard with the Babcock Driver Management System – Executrax – which not only provides operators with real-time location information, but provides valuable feedback on each driver’s driving style. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this contributes to low Total Cost of Ownership on all DAF models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://roadtransport.news/tags/driver-training/">Driver training</a> is also offered as part of the handover process, with courses available through Babcock to help drivers reduce fuel consumption, anticipate hazards better and increase road safety.</span></p>

                <p><strong>Fleet insurance is essential for businesses with vehicle fleets and drivers. </strong></p>
<p>With proper management and meticulousness, fleet managers can reduce insurance costs, improve the safety of employees and benefit from as much insurance cover as is required.</p>
<p>But with escalating insurance costs, many fleet managers, particularly those overseeing large fleets, are opting to partially cover their vehicles and even opting to self-insure.</p>
<p>Insurance is an expensive mechanism to protect losses.</p>
<p>Insurance premiums comprise broker commission, administration costs, costs associated with collecting funds (for large claims) and profit.</p>
<p>So, what would be a R100 claim, for instance, can easily end up costing R140.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is important to consider whether you should be insuring or self-insuring all of your risks.</p>
<p>From truck insurance for SMEs to comprehensive insurance for large logistics businesses with substantial fleets, there are flexible, commercial vehicle insurance options suitable for the requirements for any company.</p>
<p>If you operate in the <a href="https://roadtransport.news/tags/logistics/">logistics</a> industry, then it makes sense to take out commercial vehicle <a href="https://roadtransport.news/tags/insurance/">insurance </a>with expansive territorial limits and goods-in-transit cover included.</p>
<p>In this way you are covered if something should happen to your vehicle, driver and/or cargo at the <a href="https://roadtransport.news/tags/cross-border-trucking/">border post</a> or in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you run a shuttle service, you may want to consider taxi insurance and supplement it with fleet insurance.</p>
<p>Taxi insurance includes liability cover, which ticks the box of covering the risk of personal injury and even death when transporting people.</p>
<p>However, some risks don’t warrant the cost, time and effort involved with high excesses and claiming from an insurer.</p>
<p><strong>Watch:</strong> Do you need fleet insurance?</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HoXNKDrUc7c" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p>If you have a stable fleet, reliable drivers and can accurately predict the associated fleet costs, then you could take a particular risk upon yourself or even outsource a portion of the risk to an insurer.</p>
<p>One of the more obvious risks that fleet operators can consider taking on, is windscreen cover. Accurate, historical stats can provide insights into the frequency and severity of windscreen claims.</p>
<p>Armed with these insights, a simple calculation is all it takes to determine whether the sum of premiums and excesses are more or less than the cost of paying for the replacements out of your own funds.</p>
<p>By self-insuring windscreens, fleet operators will be motivated to negotiate the best deals from windscreen suppliers, thereby bringing down the average cost of repair.</p>
<p>Fleet operators will also take risk mitigation actions, such as ensuring that all rules are followed according to the fleet vehicle policy, to minimise the occurrence of these incidents.</p>
<p>The bigger one’s fleet, the more financial sense it makes to self-insure against windscreen losses.</p>

                <p><strong>Cost and quality matters in the oil and lubricant sectors worldwide, and even more so in Africa.</strong></p>
<p>It is all good and well bringing quality to the continent, but high pricing in the African context excludes the majority except the well-to-do businesses and elite role players.</p>
<p>Consequently, most market participants are forced to use inferior product.</p>
<p>As a business, we are moving trucks throughout various countries on the continent at any given point, interacting with local businesses and various supply chains, and we have observed that Africa is modernising at a noticeable pace.</p>
<p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href="https://roadtransport.news/cross-border-trucking-remains-dire/">Cross-border Trucking Remains Dire</a></p>
<p>In the oil sector, Africa has traditionally used older vehicles which utilised certain mineral oil products, but an increase in the standard of living across borders has led to the introduction of a modernised commercial fleet and private vehicle market.</p>
<p>This has necessitated bringing in modern, high-spec oils to the continent, but with the proviso that these still be affordable.</p>
<p>Despite the increase in economic activity, on a like-for-like basis, the buying power on the continent broadly does not match that of developed markets.</p>
<p>That’s the key.</p>
<p>Africa deserves quality at a more palatable price point, and this is achieved by streamlining operations, and carefully managing supply chains.</p>
<p>This, in turn, stimulates business activity in various countries on the continent.</p>
<p>All these components – from quality, to price, to active downstream business opportunities – build trust in a brand.</p>
<p>So, what does a multinational need to do then, to switch the script and adapt to Africa as opposed to Africa needing to adapt to a model of business that originates in developed markets?</p>
<p>It sources the best base oil at a cost that doesn’t pass unnecessary financial burden onto Africans.</p>
<p>Then, when it comes to additives, it travels to the countries with best practise and negotiates deals that suit the African market.</p>
<p>It then invests in a manufacturing process that does not compromise on quality but is designed to pass the cost savings to the end-consumer.</p>
<p>It hires and outsources various aspects of the business to Africans.</p>
<p>It is our view that any oil company that wishes to adjust the status quo in favour of the people of this continent needs to demonstrate three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It must understand the African context</li>
<li>It must be generating business on the continent and,</li>
<li>It must have a proven track record which speaks to credibility.</li>
</ol>
<p>Petrocam’s story in Nigeria is perhaps testament to this philosophy.</p>
<p>Entering a market dominated by truly colossal giants is not easy. Many have tried and many have failed.</p>
<p>However, with a client-centric approach focused on quality, reliability, and price sensitivity, Petrocam has been a steady supplier of refined products into Nigeria.</p>
<p>Today, with solar-powered filling stations around the country, Petrocam and its lubricants has been accepted as an African brand.</p>

<p>Sure, the pandemic and other geopolitical events have added challenges, but there is no denying the potential of this continent by the mere fact that <a href="https://www.citiesalliance.org/newsroom/news/cities-alliance-news/%C2%A0burgeoning-africa-youth-population-potential-or-challenge%C2%A0#:~:text=Almost%2060%25%20of%20Africa's%20population,a%20challenge%20for%20the%20continent." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">60% of this continent is under 25 years old.</a></p>
<p>Businesses that build their models in favour of this demographic today will enjoy a mutually beneficial relationship for many years to come.</p>
<p>What does any of this have to do with South Africa, the most developed market on the continent? South Africans deserve to be treated in the same way.</p>
<p>While there are glossy buildings and pockets of immense wealth, there are also large swathes of the population that are excluded from quality and durability on price point alone.</p>
<p>Beyond that, why should the wealthier pay more just because they can?</p>
<p>This is the pain point that Petrocam hopes to fill with its African experience: provide quality at a far more inclusive price.</p>
<p>By doing this, South Africans, like their African counterparts don’t have to settle for inferior quality because of cost.</p>

                <p><strong>MAN Automotive South Africa had a phenomenal year in 2020 despite the well-documented challenges. </strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company is particularly proud of its net sales volumes from its premium TG product range, which enabled it to achieve its best extra-heavy truck market share since 2006. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2020 also saw MAN Automotive's extra-heavy TGM, TGS and TGX models take the company onto the local sales podium. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since 2014, MAN Automotive has risen from the number seven market position to the number three market position. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company's EfficientLine on-highway and XHD on-off highway 6x4 truck tractors have led the way – proving both payload productivity and fuel-efficiency consistently – and often setting the benchmark for Total Cost of Ownership in those industry segments.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/P5.JPG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P5-xs.JPG 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P5-sm.JPG 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P5-md.JPG 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P5-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P5-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P5-2xl.JPG 1600w"  alt="MAN TG2 front three-quarter" width="800" height="640"></figure>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">From May 2020 onwards, MAN performed month-on-month better than in 2019 in both volume of used sales and used sales prices. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It ended the year with the lowest stock level in years and healthy demand for its used vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, the rental business more than doubled in size from 2019 to 2020. The manufacturer has also embarked on bus rentals with huge success. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Dealer Developments</strong></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MAN Automotive has taken ownership of George, PE and East London to run these facilities as wholly-owned subsidiary territories rather than through private capital dealerships.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The manufacturer also undertook facility expansions at the Centurion and Pietermaritzburg sites. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Centurion now hosts the full MAN Training Academy, while Pietermaritzburg hosts the value-adding Truck Modification Centre.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Conservation Efforts</strong></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 54,000 sqm MAN Truck and Bus assembly plant is located in Pinetown, KwaZulu-Natal.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The plant was established in 1962 and is instrumental in assembling MAN Truck and Bus chassis for South Africa and the SAE region.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/P7.JPG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P7-xs.JPG 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P7-sm.JPG 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P7-md.JPG 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P7-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P7-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P7-2xl.JPG 1600w"  alt="MAN TG2 interior RHD" width="800" height="534"></figure>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MAN assembles different TGS and TGM models in the truck segment. These vehicles have different ratings based on customer needs and applications. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MAN also assembles both front and rear-engined bus chassis here as required. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The plant imports kits from Germany and Brazil and receives some local materials to complete the chassis. It is a very lean set up and has the capacity to make 14 chassis per shift. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While being an operations plant, the MAN team works in different directions to support the environment and localization efforts.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The plant generates electricity through solar panels, which are installed on the roof. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Excess energy is fed back into the power grid. MAN Automotive has also started reducing the consumption of diesel to minimize pollution by shifting to electrical energy. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Water conservation and recycling is a routine activity. The focus here is on continuous improvement in all areas.   </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The plant has won awards at the international level for many years with good practices implemented. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company also supports community development through Corporate Social Responsibility activity, assists some schools/families, and trains students to develop further.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Flexible Finance</strong></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Covid-19 has severely impacted some transport operators and logistics service providers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MAN and its financing arm, <a href="https://man-finance.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MAN Financial Services</a>, have supported many customers by refinancing their rolling assets over longer periods or restructuring their maintenance contracts.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the Rate of Exchange severely impacted the brand, it managed to help many customers with existing contract adjustments in the spirit of partnership.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Given the current economic climate, striving for the lowest possible total cost of ownership is now more relevant than ever before. </span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/P6.JPG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P6-xs.JPG 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P6-sm.JPG 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P6-md.JPG 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P6-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P6-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/25/responsive/P6-2xl.JPG 1600w"  alt="MAN TG2 side view" width="800" height="640"></figure>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MAN had to train its front-line staff to unpack all fixed and variable cost aspects much more transparently for its customers and hone every cost element to the most competitive position possible. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This remains MAN's mission, and it continues to improve on every component of the cost calculation.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Entry-level requirements to be a serious player in heavy-duty trucking include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Having the full package of truck specification hardware </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Finance and funding instruments</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Various product warranties</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Repair and maintenance contracts</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Life asset management </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Telematics and fleet management services</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">End-of-term guaranteed residual value linked to specific vehicle return conditions</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MAN says all of its front-line sales and support staff know and understand these offerings to a tee.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is crucial since communication and training bring a clear differentiating edge in the marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Bright Future</strong></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MAN will continue to move towards its vision of being the first choice in transportation for its customers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To ensure it keeps itself honest to this cause, it continues to embrace the strategic pillars which it deems enablers for success.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company says it foresees that 2021 will be the most successful year ever for its current TG product range. </span></p>
<p><strong>Watch:</strong> The New MAN Truck Generation</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4CacbdSJsk0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">And, the latest generation of MAN trucks launched in Spain in 2020 will arrive in South Africa in late 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Only a few minutes in the company of this totally re-designed vehicle makes it abundantly clear why MAN's TGX is the European Truck of the Year for 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With MAN customers rating it the best performing European OEM in the competitive Customer Satisfaction Index over the last half of 2020, the future looks bright for 2022 and beyond.</span></p>

                <p><strong>Ctrack South Africa will break away from Inseego following a purchase by investment management firm Convergence Partners. </strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Convergence Partners will purchase the shares of the current South African entities.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inseego decided to divest Ctrack following a new demand on technology and Inseego’s 5G business, accelerated by the recent global pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A strategy to focus on target markets that are closely aligned with their 5G business growth.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We believe that this new partnership will bring a wealth of business knowledge and envisage many opportunities and positive synergies to benefit our business in general,” explains Hein Jordt, managing director of Ctrack SA.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Our continued growth and success are what has enabled us to show favourable results, a motivator for Convergence Partners to invest during these times.” </span></p>
<p><strong>Watch:</strong> Ctrack and Vehicle Tracking</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FyiRwj7uuCc" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The business will continue in its current form and retain the Ctrack brand name, which spans 30 years. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ctrack will continue to use their brand and related product names in the markets they serve.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It will expand into new territories in Africa and the Middle East while developing world-class technologies for its customers.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Our interest in the business relates to its proven market leader in the development of analytics solutions using big data extracted from the cloud platform,” says Mr Andile Ngcaba, chairman of Convergence Partners.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We believe that our ownership of Ctrack will catalyze to enhance and accelerate its digital ambitions further,” Ngcaba concluded.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Ctrack’s IOT and data analytics capabilities are a key component of an emerging sector in Africa and a good fit with our strategy of identifying high growth market players that build digital infrastructure in the continent,” adds Brandon Doyle, CEO of Convergence Partners.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We believe our expertise can elevate the Ctrack business to new heights.” </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The management of Ctrack are confident this new partnership will open up a gateway of opportunities for the business. The company is better positioned to move forward and capture market opportunities,” concluded Jordt.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. It is expected to close during the second quarter of 2021.</span></p>
