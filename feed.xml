                <p><strong>Ford Trucks is kicking off 2021 with two new product variants, plus updated services and technologies throughout its current product range, launched in 44 countries.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Ford F-MAX family, which now includes two new variants, F-MAX Blackline and F-MAX L, including new specifications and features, is bringing connected mobility technologies to Ford Trucks customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is introducing remote-control features with its ConnecTruck technology, offering more convenience and greater efficiency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"As an innovative brand that listens to our customers’ needs, we focus our R&amp;D efforts on bringing next-generation technologies to the market,” says Serhan Turfan, Vice President at Ford Trucks.  </p>
<p dir="ltr">“We believe we can add the most value for our customers by lowering their total cost of ownership. With each new product we develop, our goal is to help our customers manage their business more profitably.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are proud to introduce a new range of products and technologies to our customers all over the world. We will continue to deliver more efficiency, even better performance and cutting-edge technologies for our customers.’</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>F-MAX Blackline will be produced in a limited edition</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Ford F-MAX Blackline, an exclusive variant of the international award-winning F-MAX, will be produced as a limited edition. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Each vehicle will feature a special serial number and the Blackline Series emblem on its door.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Only 250 units will be produced for this limited edition, which will be available in a special ‘moondust’ silver exterior colour, with blue and black stripes that accentuate the vehicle’s style, as well as black LED headlamps, black wheels, and black mirror caps. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The F-MAX Blackline features a high-end interior design, with seats trimmed in black with blue stripes and stitch details, in addition to blue highlights and stitch details on the leather steering wheel and spacious overhead storage areas. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The F-MAX Blackline's front console as well as bed and under-bed storage areas also feature distinctive black design details.</p>
<p dir="ltr">ConnecTruck offers new features that make life easier for drivers and fleet managers</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ford Trucks is transforming its vehicles into data-driven, connected mobility products, equipped with next-generation technologies that benefit customers. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The new technologies include features such as GPS-based cruise control and multimedia system that make life easier for drivers and fleet managers. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The new remote-control features also enable users of the My Ford Trucks app to control their vehicles remotely, giving drivers an even higher level of comfort.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the online portal <a href="http://www.connectruckglobal.com/">ConnecTruckGlobal.com</a> has been expanded to include new features, especially for fleets. </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/FT_Blackline-3.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/FT_Blackline-3-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/FT_Blackline-3-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/FT_Blackline-3-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/FT_Blackline-3-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/FT_Blackline-3-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/FT_Blackline-3-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="Ford Trucks FT Blackline" width="800" height="537"></figure>
<p dir="ltr">Now, it allows fleet managers to track their vehicles on a desktop computer or tablet, with bonus features in addition to the mobile app. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The new features give drivers and fleet managers access to historical vehicle data and route information, all within a few clicks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New F-MAX L, featuring a longer wheelbase and up to 5,000 km range on a single tank </p>
<p dir="ltr">Ford Trucks aims to exceed its customers’ expectations with the new F-MAX L, featuring a longer wheelbase and a range of up to 5,000 kilometres on a single tank. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The F-MAX L’s 1350-litre fuel tank is 300 litres larger than the standard F-MAX tank, offering significant transportation advantages in combination with the truck’s expanded 3750 mm wheelbase. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Customers can also choose a 1050-litre tank option by simply selecting a longer wheelbase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">”Eco+ Mode” is now standard in all F-MAX variants, reducing fuel consumption by up to 5% </p>
<p dir="ltr">As fuel consumption and total cost of ownership are the most important criteria in the heavy commercial vehicle sector, Ford Trucks introduced “Eco+ Mode”, allowing drivers to increase fuel efficiency by up to 5%. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Starting in 2021, Eco+ Mode will be a standard feature in all F-MAX variants.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/Ford-Trucks-FT-Interior.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/Ford-Trucks-FT-Interior-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/Ford-Trucks-FT-Interior-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/Ford-Trucks-FT-Interior-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/Ford-Trucks-FT-Interior-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/Ford-Trucks-FT-Interior-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/Ford-Trucks-FT-Interior-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="Ford Trucks FT lIne Interior" width="800" height="527"></figure>
<p dir="ltr">When Eco+ Mode is activated, the system takes actions to automatically reduce fuel consumption. The Max Cruise feature sets the most efficient vehicle speed based on road conditions and topography identified using GPS data. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Eco Roll is also activated, allowing for optimal acceleration when driving downhill, so that the truck covers the maximum distance with minimum fuel consumption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When Eco+ Mode is switched on, engine power is limited to 450 PS and vehicle speed to 85 kilometres per hour. </p>
<p dir="ltr">If the vehicle idles for longer than five minutes, the engine automatically shuts off to save fuel. This is especially beneficial if the vehicle is left running while waiting at customs or loading.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, the high-performance kickdown feature is deactivated in Eco+ Mode to conserve fuel. Fleet owners can control and monitor all these features remotely using the My Ford Trucks mobile app.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Road Trucks series are now even more comfortable with ZF EcoTronic 9-speed automated transmission</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ford Trucks engineers analyzed the expectations and behaviors of European customers, and offered new 9-speed automated transmission in road series. </p>
<p dir="ltr">It will provide drivers significant driving comfort, especially in urban areas with heavy traffic, while also reducing fuel consumption and, consequently, the total cost of ownership. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The ZF EcoTronic 9-speed automated transmission offers better driving comfort in 330PS light tipper and light road trucks. </p>
<p dir="ltr">And, by eliminating gear shifting, it helps utility vehicles such as fire trucks to perform even faster during situations where every second counts.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/Ford-Trucks-FT-Max.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/Ford-Trucks-FT-Max-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/Ford-Trucks-FT-Max-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/Ford-Trucks-FT-Max-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/Ford-Trucks-FT-Max-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/Ford-Trucks-FT-Max-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/11/responsive/Ford-Trucks-FT-Max-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="Ford Trucks FT-Max" width="800" height="570"></figure>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Rear Steerable Axle, improved manoeuvrability and turning radius</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The engineers at Ford Trucks understand the importance of manoeuvrability and a small turning radius during urban use and they developed a new rear steerable axle to improve manoeuvrability in 9LT 6X2 vehicles. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The new system improves the turning radius by 9%, offering a more comfortable driving experience, especially in confined urban settings. </p>

                <p><strong>Volvo Trucks’ new Volvo FH is made for a truck’s most precious cargo; the driver.  </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a re-imagined cab, innovative safety features and a driver-focused working environment, the key aim of the new design is to give the driver a more productive, safe and comfortable life on the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Volvo FH series has been a favourite among truck drivers for many years, especially for those who spend a good portion of their lives on the road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the new Volvo FH, we are continuing our clear focus on designing trucks and offering services that can help drivers do an outstanding job,” said Marcus Hörberg, vice president of Volvo Group Southern Africa.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A good driver can make a huge contribution to a fleet owner’s profitability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By launching this new truck, which prioritises the professional driver’s productivity and comfort, we have taken an important step forward in helping our customers attract and retain the best drivers in the industry.”</span></p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ipRxsFFphl4?feature=youtu" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>The ultimate working environment </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attention given to drivers is most obvious in the updated interior working environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their workspace is centred around a modernised dashboard, which features a fully digital 12-inch high resolution instrument display and includes an open storage space with motion-sensor controlled lighting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instrument display allows the driver to choose up to four different screen views, depending on the driving situation and the information they prefer to have displayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">9-inch side display will provide infotainment, navigation assistance, transport information and camera monitoring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The display, which is within easy reach, allows the driver to interact in numerous ways: with the intuitively positioned buttons on the steering wheel, through voice control, or directly via the touchscreen and display control panel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A passenger corner camera has also been added for additional visibility and safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Easy access to a variety of information increases the driver’s ability to perform more efficiently, safely and comfortably,” said Eric Parry, product manager at Volvo Trucks South Africa.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The presentation of information has improved significantly with the new displays. Interactions that require the driver’s attention are now concentrated on the side display, which is placed within easy reach of the driver’s seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distractions are therefore minimised as key driving information is shown clearly on the user-friendly and easily-viewable instrument display.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving inside the cabin is easier than ever with the new slimmer, ergonomically designed I-Shift gear selector. There is also a wide range of customisation options with new fabrics and colours.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/Volvo-FH.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="Volvo FH" width="800" height="300"></figure>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Sophisticated design &amp; smart technologies</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bold new look of the exterior is characterised by the signature V-shaped headlights which have now been moved outwards to align with the feature line of the cab doors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The turn indicators have also been moved to the door, giving the truck both improved aerodynamics and a more confident look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wiper panel is cleaner and slimmer while a bigger iron mark makes the new Volvo FH easily recognisable even from a distance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The new generation Volvo FH combines the most successful elements from the previous FH series with smart technologies and a functional, human-centric design,” said Parry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The result is an intelligent and sophisticated truck that helps the driver deliver outstanding performance under any conditions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>New adaptive high beam headlights</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo Trucks has always put safety above all else.  The FH’s new adaptive high beam headlights are a prime example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system improves safety for all road users by automatically disabling selected segments of the LED high beam when the truck approaches oncoming traffic or another vehicle from behind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This groundbreaking feature gives drivers far better nighttime driving conditions, especially on rural South African roads,” says Parry.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further safety enhancing features on the Volvo FH include Downhill Cruise Control, which sets a maximum speed to help prevent unwanted acceleration when travelling downhill, and an improved Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) that works at all speeds, even down to a standstill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Electronically controlled Brake System (EBS), which is a prerequisite for safety features such as Forward Collision Warning with Emergency Brake and Electronic Stability Control, now comes as standard on the new truck. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo Dynamic Steering, with the safety systems Lane Keeping Assist and Stability Assist, will be standard on certain models and also as an option for selected others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visibility is further improved by the addition of a passenger corner camera that provides a complementary view of the side of the truck on the side display. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature is standard on all models.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/Volvo-FH-trucks.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-trucks-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-trucks-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-trucks-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-trucks-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-trucks-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-trucks-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="Volvo FH trucks" width="800" height="459"></figure>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Improved fuel efficiency &amp; productivity</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using various driveline and chassis configurations, the new Volvo FH can be tailored to suit a wide range of applications and enable significant fuel and CO² savings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In long-haul operations for instance, the new Volvo FH with the updated D13A engine with Torque Assist can deliver fuel savings of up to 3%.*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo Torque Assist is intended to reduce fuel consumption by providing more efficient driving when the cruise control is disabled in long haul operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These innovative functions will help drivers save fuel even when cruise control is not activated.  I-Cruise, Volvo Trucks’ intelligent cruise control, is still the best way to optimise fuel consumption, but sometimes it might not be applicable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo Torque Assist is designed to give more fuel-efficient driving by automatically adapting the truck’s torque and acceleration to the road topography, the load and speed changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another supporting function keeps the amount of injected fuel constant after the engine’s ‘green range’ has been passed. The slightly compromised performance is compensated by improved fuel economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pedal map has also been recalibrated. A less sensitive pedal creates a smoother torque development, which, in turn, makes the truck easier to control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software also gives a more significant result with heavy loads, many slope changes or large speed variations, while drivers transporting lighter loads with constant speed on flat roads will save less fuel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many European markets, the Volvo FH is available with the Euro 6 compliant gas-powered LNG engine that offers fuel efficiency and performance on par with that of Volvo’s equivalent diesel trucks, but with a far lower climate impact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gas engine, which is currently being tested in SA</span><strong>,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can run on either biogas, which cuts CO² by up to 100 percent, or natural gas which reduces CO2 emissions by up to 20 percent when compared with Volvo’s equivalent diesel trucks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This relates to emissions from the vehicle during usage, known as tank to wheel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Productivity, another important customer priority, is further optimised on the Volvo FH due to its capacity for increased front axle loads, as well as tag and pusher axles with improved steering angles to reduce tire wear and improve manoeuvrability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truck is also available with Tandem Axle Lift, enabling the rear axle to be disengaged and raised when the truck is not loaded, reducing the fuel consumption. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Facts about the new Volvo FH </strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cabs: Low sleeper cab, Sleeper cab, Globetrotter cab and Globetrotter XL. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exterior and interior trim packages for individual design. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diesel engines are available with different emissions standards. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The D13A Euro 3 engine is available with 400 hp/ 2200Nm, 480 hp/ 2400 Nm and 520 hp/ 2500 Nm.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Euro 5 variant available in South Africa on request.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Gear changing system: I-Shift with software packages for different areas of application. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Drivers can now drive with more confidence, as the FH offers a multitude of enhancements,” said Hörberg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As long-haul drivers spend so much of their time on the road, we focussed on their comfort, safety and efficiency.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe the new FH delivers on all of that, and more.”</span></p>
<p><em>*The fuel improvement claim is calculated by comparing costs of diesel D13A Euro 3 with Torque Assist to D13A Euro 3 without Torque Assist.  Actual fuel economy may vary depending on many factors such as the driver’s experience, use of cruise control, vehicle specification, vehicle load, actual topography, vehicle maintenance and weather conditions.</em></p>

                <p><strong>In one of Serco’s biggest and most significant deals of 2020, the company has built 28 refrigerated vehicles for Sequence Logistics.</strong></p>
<p>The 24 state-of-the-art Protec Steel Frostliner trailers and four truck bodies have been delivered to Sequence Logistics, and are in use transporting frozen and fresh food throughout South Africa from its branches in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.</p>
<p>The multi-million rand deal is seen as a reflection of Sequence Logistics’ faith in the South African economy despite all the challenges brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as their confidence in the quality and affordability of Serco products.</p>
<p>Mr Gerhard Coetzee, Finance Director of Sequence Logistics which provides temperature-controlled distribution, warehousing, and supply chain services, said he was very pleased with his company’s new acquisitions. </p>
<p>“After looking at all the options on the market we gave the full order to Serco as overall they offered the most."</p>
<p>"The purchases were part of our fleet replacement and expansion programme which we are pursuing aggressively so further business with us could be in the pipeline for Serco.</p>
<p>“What really impressed us,” said Coetzee, “is the technology Serco is using – the Protec steel panels are definitely the feature and the technology needed for a better solution for the long term which is exactly what we want.”</p>
<p>He said new signage had been branded on all the trailers by Iconic Solutions while the majority of the fridge units were installed by GEA.</p>
<p>Serco sales representative who handled the deal, Corine Opperman, said one of the biggest challenges had been to meet the set delivery deadline.</p>
<p>“The team worked hard to meet the deadline!”</p>
<p>CEO of Serco Clinton Holcroft said with not a lot of business around there had been hectic competition for the Sequence Logistics contract.</p>
<p>“So I see it as a feather in our cap that after appraising all the different options available they decided the value proposition we offer is the best and gave us the whole order.”</p>

                <p><strong>UD Trucks Southern Africa has announced the launch of two new additions to its Croner range.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The world has changed significantly during the past year, and so has the way we live our lives and run our businesses,” says Filip Van den Heede, managing director of UD Trucks Southern Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While adhering to government regulations, we also understand that there is a need to continue with economic activities, and that is why we are more committed than ever to support the logistics industry in the country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the company commends the strong resilience of the local transport industry that supported the good recovery of the market in 2020 after the hard lockdown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe this challenging spirit will continue into 2021, as we remain positive about the future and committed to support logistics in our region,” stated Van den Heede.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>New Additions to Croner Range </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch in 2017, UD Trucks’ Croner range originally operated only in the Heavy Commercial Vehicle (HCV) segment.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through UD Trucks’ expansion programme, the new Croner truck-tractor will be classified as an Extra Heavy Commercial Vehicle, operating in the up to 350hp lightweight truck-tractor segment.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new LKE 15-tonne freight carrier will operate in the 8-tonne payload segment in the HCV segment. </span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/5/Croner-4x2-PKE280-truck-tractor-a-_1_.webp" alt="UD Trucks' Croner distribution truck" width="800" height="534"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rory Schulz, UD Trucks Southern Africa’s marketing and sales director, says the company is expanding its Croner range to improve their offering in urban and inter-city distribution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the very competitive 8-to-9-tonne payload segment, we saw the need arise for a fuel efficient, high payload unit with good drivability at good value for money.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the new model introductions, we are improving payload, fuel efficiency and adding more driver comfort, as well as extending service intervals,” adds Schulz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With UD Trucks Telematics Services as standard and a region wide dealer network, fleet owners are supported no matter where they operate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Croner LKE 210 freight carrier boasts a GH5, 5-litre engine and an Allison 2500 series automatic transmission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 850 Nm of torque along with a good transmission ratio ensure the truck can quickly get to the 60km/h mark in city, or to the 80km/h where the law allows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LKE 210 has a low tare mass and optimised wheelbase of 5 500mm for both volume and mass payloads.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this combines to provide a truck with class-leading payload productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Allison automatic transmissions ease the job at hand for drivers who spend the day in the urban environment, facing long hours of traffic with multiple stops and cargo drops,” explains Schulz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The new generation torque converter with early lock-up also ensures a smooth and easy drive so driver fatigue is reduced, which means the driver can concentrate on situational driving.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Additionally, the enhanced power shifts lead to more efficient fuel consumption, comfort, manoeuvrability and performance.”</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/5/automatic-transmissions.webp" alt="UD Trucks Automatic Transmission" width="800" height="534"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Croner 4x2 PKE 280 truck-tractor has a GH8, 8-litre engine and an Allison 3000 automatic transmission series, with similar emphasis on urban and city-to-city distribution, as well as focus on inter-regional haul.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, UD Trucks also introduced a Croner 6x2 PDE280 freight carrier, which brings the total of variants in this range to 16 models.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The work a vehicle does, and the resources required to do it, are essential to the success of any fleet,” continues Schulz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Productivity to us means how much payload you can carry, at the highest possible legal speed, with as little fuel as possible. And the Croner certainly delivers on all these factors in a smart and modern way, day in and day out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UD Trucks’ Croner range is assembled at its plant in Rosslyn, Gauteng, according to the company’s global quality standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we originally launched the Croner range, we wanted to offer fleet owners trucks and solutions that maximise uptime and productivity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These new additions to the Corner family are no exception,” said Van den Heede.  “We know how important it is to make every moment count in the transport business.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We made bold moves last year during tough times and the results are showing,” explains Maretha Gerber, Head of Mercedes-Benz Trucks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This could not have been possible without the dedication and resilience demonstrated by our internal staff and dealer partners to excel, collaborate, adjust and push ahead through all that was thrown at us and for this we are deeply grateful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can all agree that 2020 was tough not just for our company, but for the entire trucking industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is therefore humbling to celebrate this success, as it attests to the trust our customers continued to place on our brand when working tirelessly, across different industries, under unique operating conditions and for this I would like to sincerely thank all our customers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brand also attributes last year’s performance to the successful launch of the 2020 <a href="http://www.truck-of-the-year.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Truck of the Year</a> title holder the New Actros, which was well received by the South African market due to the ground breaking innovations offered in the range. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the expansion of the Arocs range with six new models meant that the brand had a complete HDT portfolio to offer to its customers within the segment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking into the start of 2021, as the trucking industry continues to weather the COVID-19 storm, of key importance to the brand remains the determination to deliver uninterrupted sales and service to all customers across Southern Africa.</span></p>

                <p><strong>Volvo Trucks South Africa has introduced four new truck ranges to the local market, with a strong focus on the driver environment, safety and productivity.  </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of the four new-generation extra heavy commercial trucks; the <a href="https://roadtransport.news/new-volvo-fh-arrives-in-sa/">Volvo FH</a>, FH16, FM and FMX, is the biggest in the company’s history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our aim is to be our customer’s ultimate business partner and help them attract the best drivers in an increasingly competitive market,” says Marcus Hörberg, vice-president of Volvo Group Southern Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are really proud of this big forward-looking investment in the future of our company, and ultimately, the success of our customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the new models are locally assembled in the company’s plant in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this purpose, Volvo Trucks invested more than R2 million in the upgrade tooling and equipment in its plant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst the travel constraints induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, Volvo Trucks also invested in the installation of innovative IT equipment and technology, which allowed Volvo Trucks’ global experts to remotely support the South African team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ensured that the company’s highest levels of manufacturing standards and quality assurance are still implemented despite the challenges caused by the necessary lockdown measures.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that a fleet’s uptime is now more critical than ever, so we offer the support that operators require in these demanding times,” said Hörberg.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is how fleet owners do more, and we believe that this is a new chapter in the world of transport. Building services and support around our customers’ businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>Not enough truck drivers</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An expected growing demand for transport is putting pressure on the availability of skilled drivers worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help customers recruit and retain the best drivers, Volvo Trucks has focused strongly on developing the new trucks to make them safer, more efficient and more attractive working tools for qualified drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Drivers who handle their truck safely and efficiently are an invaluable asset to any transport company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Responsible driving behaviour can help reduce CO² emissions and fuel costs, as well as helping reduce the risk of accidents, injury and unplanned downtime.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our new trucks will help drivers work even more safely and productively and give our customers stronger arguments when competing to attract the best drivers,” continues Hörberg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The various truck models in Volvo Trucks' range are available with many different cab models and can be optimised for a wide range of applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In long-haul trucks, the cab is often the driver's second home. In regional transport trucks it often serves as a mobile office, while in construction the trucks are robust, practical work tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, visibility, comfort, ergonomics, noise level, manoeuvrability and safety were key focal points when developing all the new truck models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truck exterior has also been upgraded to reflect the new trucks' properties and create an attractive overall design.</span></p>

                <p><strong>South Africa’s commercial vehicle market was down 18.9% in 2020, according to Isuzu Motors South Africa (IMSAf).</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IMSAf says it recorded total sales of 2 587 trucks and buses for the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company added that it’s trucks led the charge with total sales of 2 570 units, which represents 13.4% of the overall market.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year’s results make Isuzu the number one Japanese Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in the Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicle segments for eight and seven consecutive years respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the tough trading conditions, Isuzu says it’s market share increased by 0.4% in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2020 was a tough year for everyone and we found ourselves facing unprecedented challenges at every level of the business,” says Craig Uren, Sales, Service, and Marketing Senior Vice President. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I must commend team IMSAf for a job well done under very difficult circumstances. Isuzu trucks continue to demonstrate the long-term benefits of strong customer service and relationships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are also very proud to have such strong and competitive products in the key segments of the commercial vehicle market,” Uren adds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isuzu trucks have proved to be a popular choice for fleet operators due to the brand’s reputation of manufacturing durable and efficient vehicles for a wide range of commercial applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Engineering and technology is a key factor in the success of our products in this space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_manual_transmission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automatic Manual Transmission</a> (AMT) for example is an outstanding feature which brings real world benefits to fleet operators as it offers significantly more economical operation of the trucks due to less wear on transmission components.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>D-MAX Outperforms LCV Market</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isuzu reports that it performed better than expected in the Light Commercial Vehicle segment with the D-MAX bakkie. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The D-MAX managed to maintain strong sales throughout the year with a total of 12 724 units sold in 2020, compared to 16 156 units sold in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the drop-in sales volume D-MAX sales outperformed the overall LCV market which saw a decrease of 24.8% compared to the number of units sold in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isuzu gained 0.7% market share to 16.4% compared to 15.7% in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong performance was driven in part by a refreshed model year 2019 line-up and the continued success of the X-Rider nameplate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isuzu’s 7-seater SUV, the mu-X rounded up the 2020 sales with 312 units sold and a market share of 2.3%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Isuzu sales and marketing teams were able to adapt quickly to the changing environment with creative, innovative solutions to offer value to customers while driving traffic to our dealerships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also commend our dealer partners who were able to make the necessary changes and embrace the new technology and methods necessary to operate successfully under Covid-19 regulations,” Uren concludes.</span></p>
