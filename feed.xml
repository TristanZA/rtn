                <p><strong>Truck rollovers can be devastating. </strong></p>
<p>Death or injuries to those involved, damages to property or roads, being responsible for the closure of a road for hours at a time and the cost of repairs or replacement and the consequent downtime can leave a company millions out of pocket.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is seldom a week that photos of a rollover are not shared in the media.</p>
<p>The managing director of MasterDrive, Eugene Herbert, says with the right conditions a truck rollover happens easily.</p>
<p>“Trucks are prone to these kind of crashes as drivers have to contend with both a high centre of gravity and centrifugal forces that cause the truck to ‘lean’ in a curve or turn."</p>
<p>A number scenarios have high risk of rollovers.</p>
<p>"Four of these are particularly risky for truck drivers yet with the right training drivers can be prepared for what to expect and how to avoid this dangerous and costly position.”</p>

<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Scenario 1: speed and cornering</strong></span></p>
<p>Speed is estimated to be the cause of up to 45% of crashes in corners and on highway onramps and offramps.</p>
<p>“When negotiating a corner, drivers need to use height, load and angle or configuration of the corner to decide what speed is required to safely navigate the corner,” says Herbert.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Scenario 2: incorrect loading</strong></span></p>
<p>The high centre of gravity requires the load to be secured. “If the load shifts during cornering the loss of balance increases rollover risk.</p>
<p>"Tankers can also be at increased risk when partially full as the sloshing of the liquid can upset the balance, particularly when cornering,” says Herbert.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Scenario 3: abrupt or oversteering </strong></span></p>
<p>Abrupt or sharp steering movements are risky. “The high centre of gravity will cause a truck to roll over if the driver abruptly steers around an obstacle."</p>
<p>"Drivers should also be cautious of oversteering in certain situations, such as when traction decreases."</p>
<p>"When traction is regained but oversteering continues, lateral force increases along with the risk of rollover,” says Herbert.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Scenario 4: driver error</strong></span></p>
<p>A study by international organisation FMSCA, suggests that 78% of tanker rollovers are due to driver error.</p>
<p>“This can be speeding in bad weather conditions, distracted driving, driving while on medication or while fatigued and various other dangerous driving habits.”</p>
<p>The difficulty with rollovers is that once the truck starts to tip, there is nothing you can do to stop it.</p>
<p>“Additionally, drivers may only feel the start of a rollover when it is well underway. This emphasises the importance of being aware of risk factors and what is required to ensure that you eliminate all the risks you can.</p>
<p>“MasterDrive’s rollover prevention training teaches drivers about risk factors and provides guidance on how to avoid falling victim to one."</p>
<p>"Importantly, the unique engineering of the truck allows drivers to feel what an actual rollover feels like without going all the way over.</p>
<p>"It is an invaluable opportunity to understand a rollover without the financial implications,” says Herbert.</p>

                <p><strong>Webfleet Solutions is collaborating with Lytx, a global provider of video telematics solutions for fleets, to offer an integrated video-based solution. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WEBFLEET Video is a seamless integration of Lytx’s camera technology into Webfleet Solutions’ fleet management system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users will be able to access and manage both their vehicles and their in-vehicle cameras via WEBFLEET, the award-winning fleet management platform, which offers a single interface experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WEBFLEET Video combines Webfleet Solutions’ vehicle and driving data with Lytx’s advanced machine vision (MV) and artificial intelligence (AI) powered camera technology to give users the full context of how their fleet is operating on the road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gives the user more insight into critical events, helping them to prevent accidents, increase safety for the driver, enhance fleet efficiency and reduce the frequency and cost of insurance claims. </span></p>
<p><strong>Watch:</strong> Damian Penney, VP of Lytx Europe, explains how Lytx helps protect your time, drivers, and reputation</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DullC5lqzqA" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are excited to combine our expertise to equip many more customers worldwide with best-in-class solutions,” says Damian Penney, vice president, Europe at Lytx. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many fleet managers today leverage more than one technology, which can be a lot to juggle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finding opportunities to consolidate is crucial. Through this integration, customers will be able to seamlessly access industry-leading video-based driver behaviour and fleet management insights,'' Penney adds.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of video and telematics data safeguards drivers and fleets in a number of ways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, WEBFLEET uses driving behaviour data on things like idling or harsh braking to provide actionable insights and real-time feedback that supports drivers to drive more safely and sustainably. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the addition of Lytx’ video technology, fleet managers now have a better understanding of why these events occur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can protect their drivers from non-fault claims and coach them to achieve a higher level of road safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are convinced that Lytx, the leading company in video telematics, is the right partner to introduce our fully integrated video solution in WEBFLEET,” says  Raj Bajaj, Vice President Webfleet Solutions International.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Together, we can even better meet the needs of the fleets we serve with increased safety and efficiency. WEBFLEET Video will also provide clear evidence in the event of road traffic incidents.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This protects the driver against fraudulent claims, while also helping the company to avoid lengthy legal proceedings and to refute incorrect damage or injury claims”, Bajaj concludes.</span></p>

                <p><strong>The recent rains have wreaked havoc on many of the country’s roads causing millions of rands in damage to road infrastructure. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is noted that poorly maintained roads impact negatively on communities and the country as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This highlights the importance of regular maintenance and upgrades which contribute towards keeping the wheels of the economy turning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bakwena Platinum Corridor Concessionaire (Pty) Ltd (Bakwena) says it places great importance on their road users’ experience of the routes it manages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maintenance of road infrastructure assets and sharing updates on the work we are currently engaged in keeps road users informed and prepared,” says Bakwena’s Commercial Manager, Solomon Kganyago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bakwena has an ongoing Routine Route Maintenance programme which includes grass cutting, vegetation control, stormwater cleaning, fence/guardrail/signage repairs and pavement defect restoration,” he explains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our engineers regularly inspect the route to proactively carry out repairs/construction works to maintain the highest standards,” Kganyago adds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current N4 upgrade includes the addition of a 32km second carriageway on the N4 between the M17 and R512 (Brits interchange).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a three-year contract which commenced in March 2018. Kganyago says the N4 upgrade is on track and the expected completion date is July 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further construction works taking place during 2021 include the rehabilitation of the N4 east between Ga-Rankuwa interchange and Doornpoort with an expected commencement date of July 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These upgrades will improve overall safety and convenience on the route as well as enhance motorists driving experience.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We would like to thank motorists for their patience while we complete these upgrades which are necessary to ensure the N1N4 route meets the highest international standards for motorists,” concludes Kganyago.</span></p>

                <p><strong>For many drivers the prospect of a lower insurance premium might be very appealing, especially as many households recover from the economic difficulty that resulted from lockdown. </strong></p>
<p>One way in which to do this, is through driver training.</p>
<p>The managing director of MasterDrive, Eugene Herbert, recommends that all drivers contact their insurance providers about their driver training policies.</p>
<p>“As driver training can drastically reduce your chances of being involved in a crash, many insurers encourage clients to undertake driver training and reduce monthly premiums in return."</p>
<p>"Drivers win with a saving on insurance costs and insurers benefit by avoiding the considerably larger costs that come with a crash."</p>
<p>“These discounts can take various forms and percentages depending on the insurer. It is possible that some insurers offer discounts to certain groups, such as those falling into particular age groups, as they have a higher risk of crashes."</p>
<p>"Whatever the case is with your insurer, it is worthwhile finding out what value the insurer places on a driving course and how this can benefit you financially.”</p>

<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UnqOmbR2qNs" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p>Some insurers do not offer discounted premiums in exchange for driver training but this does not mean that there is no benefit for drivers.</p>
<p>“Besides the general advantages of driver training, your chance of crashing is drastically reduced, meaning you also get to avoid costly excess payments if you are in an accident.</p>
<p>“Excess can easily be equal to a good portion of your salary or savings, making even the smallest of crashes a costly endeavour."</p>
<p>"This is not to mention the costs that come from damages to other cars or property and medical expenses associated with accidents.”</p>
<p>For business owners, the savings could be massive. “Companies are often offered the same benefits that the individual driver is.</p>
<p>"If driver training becomes part of company policy, the savings extend past a monthly discount but will also result in a reduction in fleet costs, damage to your public image and costly downtime.</p>
<p>“Even companies that are self-insured will find a welcome relief from the demands on their insurance budget."</p>
<p>"When viewed from this perspective, driver training should be seen as something that is as important as maintenance or insurance itself.”</p>
<p>Whatever options are available to you, there are benefits.</p>
<p>“Insurance and driver training should be viewed as a whole. One without the other can result in additional and unnecessary expenses,” says Herbert.</p>

<p>This has a severe impact on the implementation of the highly controversial <a href="http://www.rtia.co.za/ruploads/administrative_adjudication_of_road_traffic_offences_act_1998-661.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Act </a>(AARTO), which is scheduled to be implemented in July this year.<br><br>Whilst we welcome the uncovering of corruption, it would be irresponsible and reckless for Government to proceed with the implementation of AARTO.</p>
<p>The RFA has over the years expressed concern and uneasiness about AARTO and its susceptibility to fraud, corruption, and money laundering.</p>
<p>The RTIA’s latest announcement is confirmation of our worst fears. <br><br>Once AARTO is implemented, the <a href="http://www.rtia.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTIA</a> will be handling Billions of Rand. How can we now trust the entity – especially when the dishonesty and corruption is allegedly at the highest level in the Agency?</p>
<p>We already face huge corruption, extortion and intimidation at the hands of traffic police on a daily basis and this latest development has highlighted how rampant dishonesty is in the public service – especially in the traffic law enforcement and management structures.</p>
<p>These allegations have undermined what little faith we had in RTIA. If the system is implemented, we envisage theft on a grand scale. </p>
<p><strong>Watch:</strong> <span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">The latest draft of AARTO regulations has been gazetted by the Transport Department.</span></p>

<p>The RFA once again proposes that AARTO be shelved. The continuously amended system is all about generating revenue and not at all about road safety, which was what the system was originally about.</p>
<p>Huge administrative resources will be required to implement and sustain an antiquated and cumbersome system, putting additional burdens on already-overburdened government authorities and the private sector.<br><br>The <a href="https://www.rtmc.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Road Traffic Management Corporation </a>(RTMC) – another Agency of the Department of Transport – already costs motorists hundreds of millions of Rand per annum through the levy imposed on all <a href="http://www.enatis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eNatis </a>transactions.</p>
<p>This was supposed to be a temporary measure to get the RTMC on its feet. Like all other levies,  this has become permanent with no added value to citizens.</p>
<p>The RTMC needs to step up and do its job, that is, manage road traffic according to proper traffic management strategies with effective centralised road safety interventions and operational management.<br><br>The RFA believes that proper traffic management strategies which focus resources to address hazardous locations and other aspects of unsafe road behaviour would be far more effective in improving road safety – rather than the current cumbersome AARTO system being proposed.</p>

                <p><strong>Temperature and humidity monitoring are essential, particularly when it comes to the storage and transport of temperature-sensitive goods.</strong></p>
<p>In order to maintain the integrity of the cold chain from manufacturing to distribution and retail or application of these items; real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity levels has become critical.</p>
<p>Here, businesses should look to cloud-based monitoring technology to improve efficiencies, reduce costs and prevent unnecessary loss, essentially providing a competitive differentiator through the ability to accurately manage the cold chain.</p>
<p><strong>Watch:</strong> The importance of the cold chain in distribution</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bk2j6qDwbh4" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Challenging conditions in cold chain management</strong></span></p>
<p>With the imminent rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, temperature and humidity monitoring have been the subject of much public attention.</p>
<p>This is because the vaccines have to be stored and transported under stringent temperature conditions. Maintaining the necessary temperature conditions requires two things: cooling infrastructure across the entire logistics chain, and electricity to run the cooling equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://roadtransport.news/telematics-eases-vaccine-rollout/">Telematics Eases Vaccine Rollout</a></p>
<p>Both of these factors can be challenging to uphold in South Africa, more so given the unreliability of the national power supply, which makes temperature monitoring even more important than ever.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the cold chain is broken temperature-sensitive perishable foods are degraded in terms of quality, shorter shelf life and in extreme cases, adverse health-related reactions for the people who consume such products.</p>
<p>In terms of medicine - particularly vaccines - the impact of a broken cold chain can be even worse, as medication loses its efficacy and can even cause harm if administered.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Technological advancements in temperature monitoring</strong></span></p>
<p>Cloud technology has greatly increased the efficiency of temperature monitoring systems and temperature probes can now transmit their readings automatically in real-time to a control unit which then communicates with a cloud-based platform and secure database.</p>
<p>This automatic monitoring eliminates the need for human intervention and manual temperature recording, which further facilitates Covid-19 physical distancing requirements.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Smart stock protection</strong></span></p>
<p>Automated monitoring through a cloud-based platform makes it possible to raise alerts electronically via SMS or email notification, should the temperature fluctuate outside of the permissible range.</p>
<p>Such an alert system allows the organisation to be proactive when dealing with power outages or cooling equipment failures so that corrective action can be taken before damage is done.</p>
<p>With such a monitoring system, the value to business lies in the data.</p>
<p>In addition to providing actionable alerts, the system also provides a data trail of temperature readings that is fully secure, auditable and free from human error.</p>
<p>This means that compliance reporting for the various controlling authorities can be automated, and it becomes much easier to protect stock that is often worth millions of Rands without relying on manual monitoring and reporting. </p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Careful consideration</strong></span></p>
<p>When choosing a temperature and humidity monitoring system, local businesses have many factors to consider.</p>
<p>Given the instability of electricity supply, it’s important to look for a system that provides accuracy.</p>
<p>It’s also important to examine inherent system redundancy, which needs to provide a 99.9% uptime.</p>
<p>Additionally, the chosen system needs to be recognised by the relevant accreditation bodies according to local and global standards.</p>
<p>Just as important as credentials are, so is the service and support provided by the supplier, so look for references from large blue-chip clients in the medical or food sectors.</p>
<p>Lastly, ease of configuration, use and operation must be considered and should all be capable of remote management.</p>
<p>While the market offers a lot of choice in temperature monitoring systems, it is critical not to choose based on the price tag.</p>
<p>Instead, organisations must consider the cost of losing stock, and the impact on their bottom line if their cold chain is compromised.</p>
<p>This will make it clear that the right cloud-based temperature and humidity monitoring system is a tool necessary for a competitive edge, and not simply another business operating expense.</p>
