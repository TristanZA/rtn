                <p><strong>HINO-CONNECT, a full fleet management system, will be installed as a standard fitment on the full range of trucks offered by Hino South Africa from April 2021. </strong></p>
<p>This includes the Dyna, 300, 500 and 700 models and is a joint venture with Cartrack, an international mobility solutions provider.</p>
<p>“This comprehensive telematics solution includes a three-year subscription from date of fitment and will be an important, additional tool to ensure we continue to provide the highest levels of customer satisfaction,” explained Ernie Trautmann, Vice President of Hino South Africa.</p>
<p>“Hino’s Total Support strategy, which builds strong relationships and trust with all stakeholders, and has been the backbone of our success here in South Africa for many years, will benefit hugely from the data this system will now be able to provide to our customers, Hino South Africa and Hino Japan.”</p>
<p> HINO-CONNECT will provide three sets of data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positional data for tracking and recovery as well as distances travelled.</li>
<li>Vehicle performance data including fuel consumption, oil and water temperatures and speed.</li>
<li>Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) fault reporting direct to Hino SA and the dealer concerned, who will know what is wrong before getting to the vehicle, thereby enabling quicker reaction time to get the vehicle back on the road.</li>
</ul>
<p>All data is stored for five years, with the last six months’ data available immediately.</p>
<p>“Over the years Hino has increased the number of value-added products offered to its customers, ranging from extended service intervals to competitive service and maintenance plans, warranties on replacement parts fitted by franchise dealers.</p>
<p>And now HINO-CONNECT will open the way to us considering a buyback and preowned truck programme,” added Trautmann.</p>
<p>“HINO-CONNECT means we can monitor a truck’s operating life before preparing it for resale, and in view of the high resale value of a Hino truck we will be able to offer favourable buyback rates.</p>
<p>“Hino’s ultimate objective is to offer a total logistics partnership for our customers, where the truck is the tool in an integrated solution to meet an operator’s specific requirements.”</p>
<p>Harry Louw, Cartrack’s CEO, says that his company is the only mobility solutions provider in South Africa which has everything it offers in-house.</p>
<p>This includes installation and after sales service through over 600 mobile workshops, field training, specialist onboarding teams, its own exclusive stolen vehicle recovery infrastructure, and the engineering skills to access and deliver the data required by Hino.</p>
<p>“Our sophisticated in-vehicle technology has proven its robustness and reliability in over 1.3 million vehicles across 23 countries. </p>
<p>"Our Software-as-a-Service platform is developed in-house and meets the requirements of tens of thousands of commercial customers around the world.  It is highly scalable, and we are able to quickly respond to customer requirements for additional features,” explained Louw.</p>
<p>“Software development is also ongoing as part of our continuous drive to deliver cutting edge mobility solutions, which is now extending to the use of artificial intelligence to deliver richer information to our customers.</p>
<p>"Service delivery is a core value and customer service is a lifestyle for all the Cartrack team members.”</p>
<p>“Hino South Africa continues to fare very well in the quarterly Competitive Customer Experience ratings, and we are sure that HINO-CONNECT will be a further added value offering that our customers will appreciate.</p>
<p>"We have taken our time to launch the HINO-CONNECT standard telematics system as we wanted to ensure we would have the right product and the right partner when the system was implemented.</p>
<p>"That time is now,” concludes Trautmann.</p>

<p><br>Under this global mid-range diesel collaboration agreement, Cummins will provide Isuzu mid-range B6.7 diesel platforms for use in medium-size trucks to meet global customer needs.</p>
<p>Cummins and Isuzu will closely work together to integrate the engine with Isuzu’s chassis and to meet Japan’s emission regulations.</p>
<p>Isuzu chassis powered by Cummins B6.7 diesel platform engines will be introduced in North America in 2021, and in Japan, Southeast Asia and other regions at a later date.<br><br>This collaboration will allow both companies to best serve end user needs across the globe while optimising their respective investments in both diesel and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>The engines for trucks built in Japan will be assembled at Isuzu’s plant located in Tochigi, Japan.<br><br>Isuzu and Cummins also entered into an Advanced Technology Agreement to conduct joint research for various powertrain technologies using the companies’ respective advanced engineering capabilities.</p>
<p>Both companies are committed to further enhance efficiency and emissions capability of their advanced diesel products.</p>
<p>As part of the path to carbon neutral, Isuzu and Cummins have recently expanded the partnership discussions to include new power sources, including electrical powertrain technologies.<br><br>Cummins and Isuzu continue to innovate and advance the future power sources for commercial vehicles in terms of power, quality, reliability, emissions and fuel efficiency.</p>

                <p><strong>South Africa’s transport industry is adjusting to a new normal as the effects of the COVID-19 restrictions have changed traditional supply chain models, customer behaviour, government infrastructure funding and long-established business models.</strong></p>
<p>As the economy contracts, transport industry operators face multiple business challenges, including rising operating costs, increased fuel prices, decreasing revenues and tighter margins.</p>
<p>“Scania has always been at the forefront of setting new standards in sustainable logistics solutions,” says Nomonde Kweyi, General Manager, Marketing &amp; Communications, Scania Southern Africa.</p>
<p>“Improving the quality of our products while continuously improving the flows across every part of our supply chain, eliminates waste and allows us to challenge operating costs.”</p>
<p>Scania’s New Truck Generation is setting new benchmarks in the total cost of ownership, providing customers with sustainable cost-efficiencies, and securing them a competitive advantage in their industries.</p>
<p>State-of-the-art technological leadership is behind Scania’s latest sustainable operating breakthrough.</p>
<p>Vehicle data recorded from multiple Scania trucks, in daily operation, using multiple drivers, yielded an average 10% fuel saving across the New Generation truck range.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//responsive/Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//responsive/Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//responsive/Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//responsive/Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//responsive/Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//responsive/Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="800" height="534"></figure>
<p>“Every Scania we make is equipped with smart technology, advanced sensors and wireless connectivity," explains Mark Erasmus, General Manager Sales, Scania Southern Africa. </p>
<p>"We have thousands of constantly connected vehicles providing the data needed to make informed cost savings decisions,” he adds.</p>
<p>This proven 10% fuel saving, compared to the Scania PGR range, makes the Scania New Generation the most fuel-efficient truck in South Africa.</p>
<p>“Fuel costs can equate to over a third of operators’ total operating costs,” says Erasmus, “Any improvement in fuel efficiency can provide drastic savings.”</p>
<p>But Scania isn’t resting on their laurels.</p>
<p>“The highest recorded fuel savings in the market provides our customers with the cost-savings needed to offset maintenance costs."</p>
<p>"By using the fuel savings, our customers can pay zero maintenance costs,” explains Erasmus.</p>
<p>Maintaining a truck at zero cost, especially when calculated across a fleet, has the potential to remove significant expenditure from operators’ total running costs, boosting profitability and significantly improving their ability to compete in a highly competitive market.</p>
<p><strong>Watch: </strong>Meet Scania’s next generation of trucks</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fsN_vjVE09I" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p>“Across industries, including freight and logistics, construction, mining and agriculture, we know that maintenance costs absorb much-needed revenue and profit."</p>
<p>"The New Truck Generation has the potential to pay for its own maintenance,” says Erasmus.</p>
<p>It’s total cost of ownership redefined, and Scania South Africa sees it as a game-changer that will help their customers find a sustainable revenue increase while their competitors continue to struggle with high operating costs.</p>
<p>“As challenging economic realities bite, Scania’s sustainable cost-efficiencies are driving our customers business ambitions and delivering increased profitability, that is helping them achieve otherwise elusive business growth,” concludes Erasmus.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many communities around South Africa must do without this essential resource.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">For this reason, Volvo Trucks South Africa has donated two FMX trucks to the SOS Water on Wheels project in the Western Cape, to bring water and sanitation right to communities’ doorsteps.</p>
<p class="p3">SOS NPO supports under-privileged communities and schools within the water and sanitation hygiene space (WASH).  </p>
<p>They collaborate with community stakeholders, government, and businesses to provide additional water, sanitation and hygiene sources and solutions, as well as providing non-portable water, transportation, and infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p4"><strong>Related: </strong><a href="https://roadtransport.news/motus-isuzu-supports-farmers/">Motus Isuzu Supports Farmers</a></p>
<p class="p3">It addresses sanitation, hygiene, climate change and education around these issues.</p>
<p>We also focus on economic female empowerment and create local job opportunities wherever possible within our on-site project teams. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">For this reason, two female drivers have been appointed by SOS NPO to operate the vehicles, and they will undergo an extensive four-month driver training through Volvo Trucks’ Iron Women programme.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Volvo Trucks have been involved with the SOS project since 2018, and the two trucks transport water, food and materials needed to schools and communities around the Western Cape.</p>

<p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the project has expanded to provide essential sanitation stations to curb the spread of the virus in areas where it was most needed.</p>

                <p><strong>The drought in South Africa has threatened the livelihood of many farmers but Motus Isuzu, in partnership with Isuzu South Africa and various farming assistance programmes, are working together to ease this burden.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motus Isuzu Franchise managing director, Le Roux Roux, is well acquainted with the plight of the agricultural sector and believes that if farmers cannot produce, the country will be in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The farmers are in desperate need. They have no money for food or to even send their children to school,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While Mpumalanga and the Free State received good rain and farmers expected a good harvest, several farmers in northern Limpopo had to slaughter their animals because of the drought. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The situation in the Northern and Eastern Cape provinces is equally dire,” adds Roux.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isuzu SA donated three brand-new FVZ 1400 trucks to this initiative and Motus SA have provided the drivers and the fuel for all these trips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since November, the trucks have been doing trips on an almost weekly basis, collecting feed in areas that have had good rainfall and transporting it across the country to the areas in need, often covering vast distances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organisations such as Farmers Assist and Voer ‘n Boer handle the donations of feed and identify the areas in need and Motus Isuzu ensure that these large loads are delivered where they are most needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date the three trucks have collected and distributed feed in many areas across the country, including Merweville, Vanwyksvlei, Somerset East, Upington and Pofadder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The investment in this project is substantial but it is worth it when you see the look of relief on the farmers' faces.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The effect that these deliveries have on the farmers is enormous and often means respite for their staff and the entire community,” said Roux.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feed delivery initiative involves staff at all of the Motus Isuzu dealerships.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff members from the closest dealership are our contact with the farmer and are present during collection or delivery of feed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are trying to survive the worst drought ever. There’s no more natural vegetation left on the farm, we are dependent on these fodder donations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The feed is expensive, and due to our remote location, the delivery costs are extremely high; these donations that we are receiving are worth gold,” says Charles Muller, who has been a farmer in Merweville for the past 46 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am proud to be part of this initiative. As we drive across the country, cars flash their lights to show that they appreciate what we are doing to help the farmers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that we are setting a great example for the rest of South Africa, showing what can be achieved if we work together,” states David Xaba, truck driver from Motus Isuzu Isando.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gishma Johnson, Isuzu SA Corporate Communications Manager said that one of the company’s corporate social responsibility objectives is to help communities in crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finding the right partners to get the job done is so important and demonstrated just how much can be accomplished when you work together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Farmers Assist SA approached Isuzu for assistance earlier this year, we reached out to our dealer network to garner support and are very pleased that Motus Isuzu Isando stepped up to this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motus Isuzu has four dealerships located in Isando, Vereeniging, Kimberley and Bloemfontein. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These dealerships are located near the main arteries of South Africa, including the N1, N12 and N3 and allows Motus Isuzu to best service their customers travelling these routes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Bloemfontein and Kimberley dealerships are well situated near the farming communities and service a large geographical area from their central location.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Motus Isuzu are in the process of setting up a new dealership in the North of Pretoria, on Sefako Makgatho Drive, which will allow the group to better service their customers in this area as well as those travelling north on the N1,” said Roux.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Motus Isuzu really sees this as a way of giving back to the farmers, apart from being great supporters of the Isuzu brand, the South African farming community are the back-bone of our country,” concluded Roux.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a product perspective, the next few months are exciting times for Isuzu with the arrival of the new M-UX later this year, while the new D-Max bakkie, which will be built in Port Elizabeth, will go on sale early in 2022.</span></p>

<p>The user-friendly online store will enable customers anywhere in South Africa to order Tata and Daewoo heavy commercial vehicle parts with doorstep delivery, quickly and conveniently - even in the most remote parts of the country.</p>

<p>“We are continuously looking for opportunities to improve our customers’ interaction with our products<strong>. </strong>Keeping their vehicles on the road is of extreme importance to us,” says Len Brand, CEO of Tata International Africa.</p>

                <p><strong>JAC Motors says it has maintained its market growth since its market inception in 2017 and consistently grew sales over this period.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Establishing and growing the JAC Motors brand in South Africa has been extremely rewarding," says Karl-Heinz Göbel, CEO of JAC Motors South Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From local customer acceptance of our product range to the global introduction of the company's new N55EV electric truck, this characterise the makings of a successful automotive brand.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/photos-3_880x500.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/responsive/photos-3_880x500-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/responsive/photos-3_880x500-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/responsive/photos-3_880x500-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/responsive/photos-3_880x500-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/responsive/photos-3_880x500-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/30/responsive/photos-3_880x500-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="JAC truck" width="800" height="565"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The innovative, newly-launched N55EV is a thoroughly tested electric truck from JAC Motors, fitted with its latest onboard EV technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is safe, reliable, comfortable, and economical and regarded as the perfect light truck option for logistic businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAC Motors' commercial range of trucks starts with the X200 single and double-cab derivatives, fitted with 2.8-litre turbocharged diesel engines and load capacities of more than 1 000kg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an entry-level price-point of under R300 000 for the X200 single-cab, the good news for prospective owners is that this product is also available in tipper format, further increasing the versatility of this reliable hard worker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our reliable 1.5-tonne X200 single-cab for small operators such as electricians and our 1.3-tonne double-cab workhorse that can safely transport workers to and from construction sites, are real favourites with entrepreneurs and big fleet owners," says Göbel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Watch:</strong> Reliable, fast and efficient - JAC N-Series</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The N-series range of trucks on offer by JAC Motors locally comprises four different derivatives with loading capacities varying from three to six tonne, with entry-level pricing of under R330 000 for the N56 3-tonne truck. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 3-tonne truck series features the company's highly efficient 2.8-litre turbo-diesel engine, and the 6-tonne truck is fitted with a durable, proven 3.8-litre Cummins turbo-diesel engine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 6-tonne truck without the load bin is priced under R500 000 (VAT incl.), making it a strong contender in its category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JAC Motors' five-year manufacturer's warranty and three-year service plan for the 3-tonne trucks are standard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A two-year/unlimited-kilometre manufacturer's warranty is available to owners of the 6-tonne trucks.</span></p>

                <p><strong>Distributed by Babcock in southern Africa, the latest DAF XF and DAF CF trucks are finally hitting South Africa’s highways - four years after their European launch.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, the DAF XF was chosen as the <a href="http://www.truck-of-the-year.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Truck of the Year</a> back in 2018.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically engineered for local road conditions, the latest DAF trucks offer pure excellence in transport efficiency while setting new benchmarks for driver comfort and safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sporting a striking and polished new look, DAF CF and DAF XF series trucks deliver outstanding productivity in even the toughest conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They now have higher torque, optimised drivelines, high-efficiency rear axles, and enhanced electronics performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new aerodynamic design completes the package and contributes to overall market-leading fuel efficiency.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-gavin-39370934/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Gavin</a>, sales director for Transport Solutions at Babcock, emphasises that the new DAF Trucks are not merely upgrades or facelifts of previous models, but are completely new vehicles, showcasing improved chassis, cabs, gearboxes and engines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our new DAF CF and DAF XF models are smart, efficient and profitable, setting higher standards for transport safety and productivity,” says Gavin. </span></p>
<p><strong>Watch:</strong> Newest DAF CF and DAF XF on the road</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VS6RHblErg?list=PLnKwfY95HmIwDmTTE-v88glXtE5MOFf8g" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Significant savings for long distance operators</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides a fresh exterior design featuring excellent aerodynamics, central to the new trucks’ transport efficiency is a multi-torque PACCAR MX-13 engine offering more torque at lower revolutions per minute (rpm) for higher fuel efficiency and lower noise levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The low rpm also reduces CO₂ emissions, while the trucks’ Eco Performance Mode ensures an optimal balance between high drivability and best fuel efficiency. </span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gavin says local tests carried out on the new DAF trucks in South Africa have shown an average 10% reduction in fuel costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This means significant savings for long distance operators where up to 60% of overall expenses are allocated to fuel consumption,” comments Gavin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that operators can also expect to see a reduction in maintenance costs on the new DAF CF and XF trucks, thanks to environment-specific technological adaptations at DAF Trucks Eindhoven’s manufacturing facility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These include modifications to the air intake and filtration, cooling system, suspension and transmission, as well as a new high-efficiency rear axle with low-friction wheel ends and a range of faster ratios, enabling even lower engine rpm’s for greater fuel efficiency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supplied standard with both the DAF CF and DAF XF, the latest generation TraXon automated gearbox offers less friction losses, faster upshifts, and the extended use of EcoRoll contributing to lower fuel consumption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gearbox also provides specific software settings for long haulage, liquid transport, heavy duty and off road applications. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ability to set separate transmission settings for trucks which have to change speed frequently during their daily operation contributes to exceptional vehicle efficiency as well as driver comfort,” says Gavin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other engine innovations enhancing fuel economy and performance include fully variable oil, steering pumps; a new piston ring package and skirt profile; and a new turbocharger and combustion system.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>It’s all about the driver</strong></span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/28/responsive/Image_DAF-cab-interior_wide-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="DAF interior" width="800" height="534"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to driver comfort and safety is the new DAF cab, with the DAF XF offering the largest interior space on the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the DAF CF and DAF XF truck cabs feature new temperature and climate controls to improve driver comfort, as well as best-in-class interior lighting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanded driver information enables operators to respond to hazards quicker and includes intelligent tips for economical driving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new DAF XF packs in further enhanced features that not only safeguard the driver and other road users, but also contribute to vehicle versatility, fuel efficiency and comfort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These include:</span></p>
<ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An exciting aspect of the new DAF CF and DAF XF trucks is that they are also equipped for the future fitment of predictive cruise control (PCC) which can determine the terrain the truck is negotiating and automatically adjust gears accordingly,” explains Gavin.</span></p>

                <p><strong>Fleet insurance is essential for businesses with vehicle fleets and drivers. </strong></p>
<p>With proper management and meticulousness, fleet managers can reduce insurance costs, improve the safety of employees and benefit from as much insurance cover as is required.</p>
<p>But with escalating insurance costs, many fleet managers, particularly those overseeing large fleets, are opting to partially cover their vehicles and even opting to self-insure.</p>
<p>Insurance is an expensive mechanism to protect losses.</p>
<p>Insurance premiums comprise broker commission, administration costs, costs associated with collecting funds (for large claims) and profit.</p>
<p>So, what would be a R100 claim, for instance, can easily end up costing R140.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is important to consider whether you should be insuring or self-insuring all of your risks.</p>
<p>From truck insurance for SMEs to comprehensive insurance for large logistics businesses with substantial fleets, there are flexible, commercial vehicle insurance options suitable for the requirements for any company.</p>
<p>If you operate in the <a href="https://roadtransport.news/tags/logistics/">logistics</a> industry, then it makes sense to take out commercial vehicle <a href="https://roadtransport.news/tags/insurance/">insurance </a>with expansive territorial limits and goods-in-transit cover included.</p>
<p>In this way you are covered if something should happen to your vehicle, driver and/or cargo at the <a href="https://roadtransport.news/tags/cross-border-trucking/">border post</a> or in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you run a shuttle service, you may want to consider taxi insurance and supplement it with fleet insurance.</p>
<p>Taxi insurance includes liability cover, which ticks the box of covering the risk of personal injury and even death when transporting people.</p>
<p>However, some risks don’t warrant the cost, time and effort involved with high excesses and claiming from an insurer.</p>
<p><strong>Watch:</strong> Do you need fleet insurance?</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HoXNKDrUc7c" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p>If you have a stable fleet, reliable drivers and can accurately predict the associated fleet costs, then you could take a particular risk upon yourself or even outsource a portion of the risk to an insurer.</p>
<p>One of the more obvious risks that fleet operators can consider taking on, is windscreen cover. Accurate, historical stats can provide insights into the frequency and severity of windscreen claims.</p>
<p>Armed with these insights, a simple calculation is all it takes to determine whether the sum of premiums and excesses are more or less than the cost of paying for the replacements out of your own funds.</p>
<p>By self-insuring windscreens, fleet operators will be motivated to negotiate the best deals from windscreen suppliers, thereby bringing down the average cost of repair.</p>
<p>Fleet operators will also take risk mitigation actions, such as ensuring that all rules are followed according to the fleet vehicle policy, to minimise the occurrence of these incidents.</p>
<p>The bigger one’s fleet, the more financial sense it makes to self-insure against windscreen losses.</p>
