                <p class="p1"><strong>Park Village Auctions has secured yet another collection of quality used commercial vehicles, which is sure to satisfy a continued demand among dealers, fleet and logistics managers across the board.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">So says PVA’s Natashia Goosen.</p>
<p>“While sales statistics for new commercial vehicles have only recently started recovering, used vehicle sales have remained buoyant. I believe that this will continue for some time as buyer confidence and cash flow are still under pressure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“Discerning fleet managers are turning to auctions to replenish their fleet with newer models in light of the global stock shortage on certain vehicles.”</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://roadtransport.news/actros-fleet-the-highlight-at-truck-auction/">Actros Fleet The Highlight At Truck Auction</a></p>
<p class="p1">As ever, the auction will bring to market assorted trucks, trailers, earthmoving and agricultural equipment stemming from genuine bank repossessions, business liquidation and deceased estate matters.</p>
<p class="p1">Speaking about highlights for the upcoming auction, Goosen singles out a fleet of 2018 Mercedes-Benz Actros 2646's and 3344's; a 2016/17 Mercedes-Benz Marcopolo 52-seater bus, and a 2018 Revaro hollow brick making machine.</p>
<p class="p1">After the Actros fleet, remaining truck tractor stock includes a 2017 UD Quon GW 26-450, a 2018 Volvo FMX 440, a 2016 Hino 500 1726, a Scania G460, a MAN TGS 17-374, an Iveco Stralis 480, various Freightliner Cat and Argosy's and an International Pro Sleeper.</p>
<p class="p1">Rigid trucks to be sold include a 2019 Isuzu FTS 750 and a 2017 Isuzu NPR 400, an assortment of MAN TGM 25-280, a Powerstar 4035, a FAW 8-140, a Mercedes-Benz 1617, a Hino 300, a Nissan UD40, a Mitsubishi and a Toyota Dyna.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">A 2018 Henred Fruehauf flatdeck, a 2015 Afrit dropside, a 2015 Top Trailers side tipper are available, as are Paramount, Kearny, Roadhog and SA Tuck Bodies trailers.</p>
<p class="p1">Other noteworthy lots include a Case JX90 Tractor, a 2017 Iveco 70C15 panel van, a Caterpillar 226B skidsteer and various brands of forklifts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <p><strong>The Commercial Transport Academy has secured funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID - from the American People). </strong></p>
<p>The funds will be used to launch an exciting transport and logistics programme in South Africa for women in transport-related businesses. Women completing the Candidacy Programme will earn a qualification which is recognised worldwide.</p>
<p>Women inspiring women to lead in transport - the Commercial Transport Academy (CTA) - has collaborated with USAID and the global body the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT), to design and implement a purpose driven training solution.</p>
<p>It is believed this solution will inspire women to improve their knowledge, learn new skills, and advance their management and leadership abilities, with the ultimate goal of remaining in the sector.</p>
<p>“The transport sector is one of the least gender representative sectors in South Africa,” says CTA Founder Nicci Scott.</p>
<p>“The number of women employed in the freight industry for example is as low as 18% and less than 10% are employed in management positions. This needs to change!</p>
<p>"The Candidacy Programme, specifically designed for women, aims to prepare them for career growth and leadership opportunities, through both practical and theoretical learning.”</p>

<p>The CTA is inviting employers to enrol two women working in junior or middle management positions onto the eight-month internationally recognised <em>Candidacy Programme</em>.</p>
<p>Forty four employed women will be accepted for phase one of the Programme. A total of 120 women will be trained over three years. Successful learners will be awarded the CILT International Diploma in Logistics and Transport.</p>
<p>The CILT Candidacy Programme is an e-learning programme that includes a mentorship component. “We focus strongly on skills development and capacity building,” continues Scott.</p>
<p>“The mentors are carefully selected and are skilled members of industry and/or subject matter experts. Our aim is to train and mentor women in the industry to make a positive contribution, develop and nurture a talent pipeline for the industry and to drive change in industry through diversity”.</p>

<p>The Programme will commence on 1 June 2021. It is open to employed women who have a matric, are a South African citizen, and who are currently employed in a junior or middle management role in logistics, transport, supply chain and/or warehousing/operations role, with a minimum of four years’ working experience.</p>
<p>Whilst all costs for tuition, assessment, graduation and certification, will be borne by the funds from USAID, employers will be responsible for a contribution of R8 000 towards the total cost of the Programme. </p>
<p>Employees based outside of Johannesburg should be sponsored a flight to attend their graduation by their employer.</p>

                <p><strong><span lang="EN-US">An unprecedented surge in international freight rates of up to 700 percent is putting many companies under enormous pressure and forcing them to take drastic measures to ensure their sustainability.</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">In some cases, organisations are left with little choice but to find areas where they can cut costs when moving cargo. Many organisations are looking to reduce the expenses on cargo security. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">With South Africa’s soaring crime rate, this approach could have dangerous and unintended consequences. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">As a result, service provider Rhenus Logistics South Africa is constantly looking at ways to minimise threats and ensure the integrity of its customers’ shipments, whilst reducing costs.</span></p>
<p>The number of reported truck hijackings in South Africa has escalated over the past year by an alarming 32 percent. According to Statista Research Department, 1,202 truck hijackings occurred between April 2019 and March 2020, often ending with violent attacks on drivers.</p>
<p>With the sharp increase in online shopping as a result of COVID-19, courier vehicles are now increasingly being targeted too. Heightened activity by organised syndicates, as well as opportunistic incidents, are a reality. </p>
<p>“Criminals have become much more brazen in their approach. The industry is now experiencing far more orchestrated heists, with groups of up to 25 robbers going after one delivery vehicle,” says Martin Taylor, Risk Manager at Rhenus Logistics South Africa, in a recent interview with television programme Carte Blanche.</p>
<p>“It has become a strategy of ‘shoot first, steal later’, which means that cargo drivers are now more at risk than ever. Although high-value goods are most sought-after, all cargo is at risk, which means that all deliveries are vulnerable.”</p>

<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dExO_umdHrY?t=386s" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p>Rhenus Logistics South Africa follows state-of-the-art security protocols, including ongoing anti-hijacking training for drivers, as well as vehicle tracking and on-board video surveillance that is monitored 24/7 by highly trained control room personnel.</p>
<p>“Cargo crime is not only going to continue, but will increase,” emphasises Taylor.</p>
<p>“Law enforcement bodies, including the crime intelligence unit of the South African Police Service, have expanded their operations and are doing what they can, but they don’t have the capacity to fight crime by themselves.</p>
<p>"It needs to be a collective effort involving all stakeholders, including the public. The logistics and security industries are collaborating and sharing information and resources in efforts to combat ongoing crime.”</p>
<p>In a financially constrained environment, it is understandable that importers will look for various ways to reduce costs and the temptation to cut on security can be great.</p>
<p>According to Rob Stead, Chief Operating Officer at Rhenus Logistics South Africa, the cost of security in the supply chain can be as much as 11 percent of the value of goods.</p>
<p>Stead goes on to highlight the consequences of inadequate security. “Theft results in lost sales, but also has the potential for reputational damage, should an importer‘s brand be associated with a public incident.</p>
<p>And of course, our biggest concern is for the safety of staff members and the public that needs to be ensured at all times.” In Stead’s opinion, it is important for cargo owners to carefully consider areas of risk mitigation, to optimise these expenses.</p>
<p>“Security awareness and agile, proactive risk management are essential. Importers needing to have their goods transported should partner with companies that have highly-developed security protocols and systems in place, such as 24/7 camera surveillance,” Stead explains.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null">Webfleet Solutions, Lytx Create Video-based Solution</a></p>
<p>“This will minimise risk and help them build more secure and resilient supply chains.” The key to successful risk management is vigilance and agility in adapting cargo handling processes.</p>
<p>“With our many years of experience and our global footprint, we are well-equipped to stay one step ahead in the fight against crime.</p>
<p>"It’s an ongoing process as syndicates become more and more sophisticated – so we need to constantly evaluate developments and stay ahead of the criminals,” concludes Stead.</p>

                <p>It was September 2012 when TruckStore, the used trucks &amp; buses retail outlet of Daimler Trucks &amp; Buses Southern Africa (DTBSA), officially opened its doors to buy and sell used vehicles and trailers of all brands, models, bodies and ages in South Africa.</p>
<p>The retailer has since grown to become a renowned, trusted and reliable source for used commercial vehicles in Southern Africa and has notably established itself as the best performing TruckStore outlet globally.</p>
<p>Michael Dietz, CEO of Daimler Trucks &amp; Buses Southern Africa says: “Reflecting on the TruckStore journey and seeing how this solid business model has been well adopted across Southern Africa is commendable.</p>
<p>"Today we are proud to be one of the industry’s leading used commercial vehicle retailers, and it is for this reason that we are taking the business to greater heights with the move to the new facility and the expansion of our footprint across South Africa”.</p>

<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KIvWvl-Mnp0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>TruckStore moves into a bigger and prominently located facility </strong></span></p>
<p>Following a remarkable and consecutive year-on-year performance across various aspects of its business since 2012, TruckStore has made a strategic decision to relocate to a bigger facility to accommodate growing customer demands and future growth plans.</p>
<p>Located on a 30 000sqm real estate – a stone throw away from the old facility, the new facility benefits from the excellent N1 highway visibility between the two major Gauteng airports - OR Tambo &amp; Lanseria International Airport - for the convenience of clients.</p>
<p>Annelie van Rooyen, Head of Used Trucks says: “We are immensely excited to be opening this new facility today, taking such bold steps amidst a pandemic. Centurion remains a perfect location for our business.</p>
<p>"The new facility will give us an opportunity to better serve our growing customer base, provide an improved customer experience and increase service capacity. This move represents a milestone for TruckStore and will certainly create opportunities for growth and strengthen the brand’s position in Southern Africa”.</p>
<p>The facility has ample parking for large vehicles and features a 1, 200sqm showroom and office space with great exposure and easy access.</p>
<p>Included are six open sales offices overlooking great views of the highway and allowing for flexibility and transparency to processes. The new offices make every customer visit special, with a welcoming reception.</p>
<p>At the rear of the facility is an approximately 3 000sqm fully-equipped and dedicated Mercedes-Benz approved workshop and parts centre for Mercedes-Benz TruckParts and Fuso Value Parts.</p>
<p>Included also are ten dedicated bus service bays. The workshop also provides capacity for non-Daimler brands as well as servicing of trailers. This is an extension of value added services and forms part of TruckStore’s overall strategy of being a one-stop shop to its customers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>TruckStore further expands its footprint across South Africa </strong></span></p>
<p>TruckStore is pleased to announce that it will be expanding its presence, making TruckStore products and services available across all major cities in South Africa.</p>
<p>This is a strategic decision which focuses on bringing sales activities closer to the customers by fully leveraging the existing Daimler Trucks &amp; Buses dealer network, ensuring dedication and the best sales experience going forward.</p>
<p>There is a clear strategy put in place to integrate fully into the existing authorized DTBSA dealer network.</p>
<p>Van Rooyen further adds: “We are proud of this new business model as it reaffirms our commitment to continuously support our customers irrespective of where they are. We are taking an important step in our business as we see capacity for sales growth, not only for TruckStore, but for our dealer partners as well.</p>
<p>"We want to provide the same level of sales and after-sales service that a customer would receive when purchasing a new vehicle”.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, TruckStore has a clear strategy for Southern Africa mapped out and at the core of this is customers, bringing in high-quality, competitively priced, refurbished and certified used commercial vehicles to the market to meet the ever-changing customer demands.</p>

                <p><strong>FAW Trucks achieved a significant milestone in its local history by taking the top spot in the Heavy Commercial Vehicle (HCV) segment of the local market for the first time in January this year. </strong></p>
<p>With 50 unit sales recorded for the first month of 2021, FAW Trucks had a fair lead over second-placed Hino, with 20 sales.</p>
<p>This already impressive performance was surpassed in February, when FAW Trucks sold a significant 80 HCV units, well ahead of its closest rival, Hino (58) and third-placed Isuzu (52).</p>
<p>“Since first entering the local market in 1994, it has been our mission to provide South African buyers with products of high quality that are not only well suited to local conditions, but also boast high levels of safety, convenience and comfort," says Jianyu Hao, CEO of FAW South Africa.</p>
<p>"We have managed to combine this with competitive pricing, low running costs and excellent aftersales service. Our remarkable sales success in January and February is proof that we are doing something right as more and more buyers are opting for our trucks.”</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://roadtransport.news/jac-workhorse-finds-smb-favour/">JAC X200 Finds SMB Favour</a></p>
<p>FAW’s sales in the HCV segment is driven by two models, the 8.140FL and the 15.180FL.</p>
<p>Both are ideally suited to customers in the farming and agriculture sector and have also found favour with small contractors and businesses, as well as fleet operators such as courier companies.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/39/FAW-8.140FL-5-Ton-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/39/responsive/FAW-8.140FL-5-Ton-1-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/39/responsive/FAW-8.140FL-5-Ton-1-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/39/responsive/FAW-8.140FL-5-Ton-1-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/39/responsive/FAW-8.140FL-5-Ton-1-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/39/responsive/FAW-8.140FL-5-Ton-1-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/39/responsive/FAW-8.140FL-5-Ton-1-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="FAW 8.140FL" width="800" height="515"></figure>
<p>The 8.140FL freight carrier/tipper was first introduced in South Africa in 2015 and has a body and payload allowance of 6 tonnes. Providing seating for a driver and two passengers, it features a spacious and ergonomically designed cab, while air-conditioning and a radio with MP3 and USB functionality are standard.</p>
<p>Fitted with a Euro 3 Cummins ISF 3,8-litre engine, the 8.140FL delivers a healthy 450 Nm of torque between 1 200 and 2 200 r/min, while a solid output of 105 kW is on tap at 2 600 r/min. Additional features include a full air dual circuit WABCO braking system with ABS.</p>

<p>The 15.180FL has a spacious, ergonomically designed semi-sleeper cab with a 9.8-tonne body and payload allowance.</p>
<p>Occupant comfort is a priority in FAW Trucks and therefore standard features include air-conditioning and a radio with MP3 and USB capability.</p>
<p>The engine is a Euro 2-compliant 6 557 cc, six-cylinder, in-line turbocharged unit that delivers 132 kW at 2 300 r/min and has 650 Nm of peak torque on tap between 1 400 and 1 600 r/min. Like the 8.140FL, it also has a full air dual circuit WABCO braking system with ABS.</p>

                <p><strong>Long before the Covid-19 pandemic changed the business environment as we know it, JAC Motors' X200 forward-cab light commercial vehicle (LCV) was already a popular choice among business owners worldwide.</strong></p>
<p>With Covid-19 fuelling the online industry and demand for delivery services, entrepreneurs involved in distributing products are constantly searching for more affordable and effective fleet solutions to deliver on their customers' expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://roadtransport.news/telematics-supports-e-commerce-growth/">Telematics Supports E-commerce Growth</a></p>
<p>Reliability, low running cost and versatility are critical elements in managing any fleet, and it is in these departments where the X200 impresses its owners and drivers.</p>
<p>The X200 was developed to excel in the harshest working conditions. Although it is a versatile workhorse, it comes standard with features such as air-conditioning and crumple zones to create a safe and comfortable work environment for the driver and passengers.</p>
<p>Companies supplying services like catering hire, furniture deliveries, truck hire, garden services, contractors, electricians, plumbers and many other types of small businesses are using the versatile X200.</p>
<p>"Currently, everyone is trying to find ways to do more with less due to economic pressures," says Karl-Heinz Göbel, CEO of JAC Motors South Africa.</p>
<p>"Our affordable X200 bakkie is the best workhorse choice in the local market, as it outclasses direct competitors in the price, performance, load configuration and comfort categories."</p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Compact and manoeuvrable workhorse to go where big trucks cannot</strong></span></p>
<p>It is essential in the commercial vehicle sector that an LCV's design caters for various customer groups. A forward-cab design's main benefit is the increased load box size with a much larger load volume. A forward-cab design is more practical than a standard bakkie, making these rugged workhorses ideal for business and industrial use.</p>
<p>The X200's compact size and minimum turning radius of 5.4 metres ensure easy manoeuvrability in places where larger trucks cannot navigate. The optimal ride height and ultra-flat low deck of the X200, with its dropsides, make loading and unloading easy and fast.</p>
<p><strong>Watch:</strong> JAC X200 - A perfect mini-truck for your business</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="449" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jBAn4GUr9kA" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p>A forward-cab design also incorporates other advantages that both drivers and fleet owners appreciate, such as the easy entrance and exit for drivers and crew in many load-stop-and-drop situations.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Reliable 2.8-litre turbo-diesel engine for harsh working conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>The X200 supports a proven 2.8-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine mounted under the front seats. This reliable engine produces 80 kW at 3 600 r/min and 240 Nm of torque between 1 800 and 2 000 r/min.</p>
<p>A trademark of the X200's powertrain design is fuel economy. The power is distributed via a 5-speed transmission to the rear wheels.</p>
<p>The maximum torque available at low rpm allows drivers to minimise gear changes and reduce fuel usage. The average fuel consumption of the X200 is 9.5 ℓ/100 km (combined cycle).</p>
<p>"The X200 boasts the ideal engine capacity for our country's demanding conditions. The durable 2.8-litre turbo-diesel engine produces more than 30% power than its direct competitors, resulting in outstanding functionality and everyday utility in urban and regional operations," says Göbel.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Robust chassis design for demanding working conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>The X200 supports JAC Motors' new chassis stamping and welding treatment process, developed for the heavy-duty ladder-frame chassis used in their N-Series truck range. The main benefit of a solid ladder-frame chassis is the optimum axle weight distribution that enhances safety.</p>
<p>The X200's double-wishbone independent front suspension and robust ladder-frame chassis design allow for excellent manoeuvrability and solid handling regardless of how much payload it is carrying.</p>
<p>Large disc brakes in front supported by drum brakes at the back and a Load Sensing Proportioning Valve (LSPV) deliver excellent stopping power.</p>
<p>The hydraulic assisted power steering provides excellent handling, optimised manoeuvrability and safe driving characteristics in all load states and on any road surface.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Large payload to easily transport heavy loads</strong></span></p>
<p>With a maximum permitted payload of 1 500 kg, a large load area of 4 595 mm², the X200 offers practical solutions for everyday use that will meet customer expectations for any transport task at hand.</p>
<p>The length of the X200's load box almost measures 2.8 metres. Space is optimally designed for working conditions with a lower deck height of just 785 mm. With standard dropside configuration, the X200 is ready to meet the modern-day demands of cargo transport.</p>
<p>The maximum use of axle capacities for ideal payload weight distribution ensures optimal manoeuvrability in heavy urban traffic and on open roads. The X200 can tow a braked trailer of up to 1 250 kg.</p>
<p>"The no-nonsense work attitude of the X200 explains why it is such a favourite with business owners worldwide. Its powerful engine, balanced transmission and excellent payload creates confidence whatever or wherever the haul is," adds Göbel.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>An ergonomic driver's workplace</strong></span></p>
<p>The X200 offers an elevated driving position. The results are that the driver can see and judge traffic better on the open roads, and it further improves visibility when parking at load bays.</p>
<p>Front- and rear crumple zones, side-impact protection beams, height-adjustable headlamps and an immobiliser further add to occupants' safety.</p>
<p>Remote-controlled central locking with motion-lock at 40 km/h and an engine that cannot ignite when the clutch is not engaged further contribute to the safety credentials of the X200.</p>
<p>An air-conditioned cab with comfortable cloth seats with headrests, and a height-adjustable steering wheel, make for pleasant travelling for both the driver and passengers.</p>
<p>The centre seat's backrest folds down, offering ample stowing space. The X200 comes standard with a Radio/CD/MP3 player and speakers fitted in the front doors.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e50303;"><strong>Model line-up and pricing</strong></span></p>
<p>With the most competitive pricing in its class, the X200 offers excellent value for money to get your business going.</p>
<p>Priced from R284 900, the X200 comes standard with a five-year/150 000-kilometre manufacturer warranty, including a five-year/60 000-kilometre service plan. Service intervals are scheduled for every 10 000 km.</p>
<p>The JAC X200 2.8-litre TDi 1.5-tonne range comprises three derivatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>X200 Chassis Cab – R284 900</li>
<li>X200 Dropside – R294 900</li>
<li>X200 Tipper – R324 900</li>
</ul>
<p>The X200 is also available in double-cab configuration and retails at R304 900. Fitted with the same 2.8-litre TDi engine and a payload of 1.3-tonne, the double-cab is especially popular with operators who need to transport more than three workers.</p>
<p>The double-cab can transport six people inside the cab. According to the local traffic regulations, it is illegal to transport people on the back of a bakkie on public roads.</p>
<p>"Our reliable and versatile X200 range meets our ever-increasing customer expectations and tick all the right boxes to be the star performer in any transport fleet," concludes Göbel.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">More online shopping means that there are more deliveries to be made, and the logistics industry has had to scale operations to meet the growing demand. </span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">The various levels of lockdown, COVID-19 regulations and people working from home have created a greater reliance on home deliveries, with the industry now finding itself at an all-time peak, and with more vehicles on the road than ever before.</span></span><span class="eop"> </span></p>

<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">That’s because increased demand for e-commerce has created an even greater expectation by customers to consistently receive their items when, how, and where they want – placing pressure on courier companies and drivers to meet this demand. </span></span><span class="eop"> </span></p>

<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">At the same time, businesses also need to ensure drivers follow COVID-19 regulations while out on deliveries, especially considering that they're coming into contact with more customers than ever before. </span></span><span class="eop"> </span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">Unfortunately, adding to this pressure is the increased need for driver and cargo safety. While the immense growth in online shopping has boosted the e-commerce sector, it’s also resulted in more criminals shifting their focus to courier vehicles, targeting goods in transit. </span></span></p>

                <p><strong>HINO-CONNECT, a full fleet management system, will be installed as a standard fitment on the full range of trucks offered by Hino South Africa from April 2021. </strong></p>
<p>This includes the Dyna, 300, 500 and 700 models and is a joint venture with Cartrack, an international mobility solutions provider.</p>
<p>“This comprehensive telematics solution includes a three-year subscription from date of fitment and will be an important, additional tool to ensure we continue to provide the highest levels of customer satisfaction,” explained Ernie Trautmann, Vice President of Hino South Africa.</p>
<p>“Hino’s Total Support strategy, which builds strong relationships and trust with all stakeholders, and has been the backbone of our success here in South Africa for many years, will benefit hugely from the data this system will now be able to provide to our customers, Hino South Africa and Hino Japan.”</p>
<p> HINO-CONNECT will provide three sets of data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positional data for tracking and recovery as well as distances travelled.</li>
<li>Vehicle performance data including fuel consumption, oil and water temperatures and speed.</li>
<li>Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) fault reporting direct to Hino SA and the dealer concerned, who will know what is wrong before getting to the vehicle, thereby enabling quicker reaction time to get the vehicle back on the road.</li>
</ul>
<p>All data is stored for five years, with the last six months’ data available immediately.</p>
<p>“Over the years Hino has increased the number of value-added products offered to its customers, ranging from extended service intervals to competitive service and maintenance plans, warranties on replacement parts fitted by franchise dealers.</p>
<p>And now HINO-CONNECT will open the way to us considering a buyback and preowned truck programme,” added Trautmann.</p>
<p>“HINO-CONNECT means we can monitor a truck’s operating life before preparing it for resale, and in view of the high resale value of a Hino truck we will be able to offer favourable buyback rates.</p>
<p>“Hino’s ultimate objective is to offer a total logistics partnership for our customers, where the truck is the tool in an integrated solution to meet an operator’s specific requirements.”</p>
<p>Harry Louw, Cartrack’s CEO, says that his company is the only mobility solutions provider in South Africa which has everything it offers in-house.</p>
<p>This includes installation and after sales service through over 600 mobile workshops, field training, specialist onboarding teams, its own exclusive stolen vehicle recovery infrastructure, and the engineering skills to access and deliver the data required by Hino.</p>
<p>“Our sophisticated in-vehicle technology has proven its robustness and reliability in over 1.3 million vehicles across 23 countries. </p>
<p>"Our Software-as-a-Service platform is developed in-house and meets the requirements of tens of thousands of commercial customers around the world.  It is highly scalable, and we are able to quickly respond to customer requirements for additional features,” explained Louw.</p>
<p>“Software development is also ongoing as part of our continuous drive to deliver cutting edge mobility solutions, which is now extending to the use of artificial intelligence to deliver richer information to our customers.</p>
<p>"Service delivery is a core value and customer service is a lifestyle for all the Cartrack team members.”</p>
<p>“Hino South Africa continues to fare very well in the quarterly Competitive Customer Experience ratings, and we are sure that HINO-CONNECT will be a further added value offering that our customers will appreciate.</p>
<p>"We have taken our time to launch the HINO-CONNECT standard telematics system as we wanted to ensure we would have the right product and the right partner when the system was implemented.</p>
<p>"That time is now,” concludes Trautmann.</p>

                <p><strong>South Africa’s transport industry is adjusting to a new normal as the effects of the COVID-19 restrictions have changed traditional supply chain models, customer behaviour, government infrastructure funding and long-established business models.</strong></p>
<p>As the economy contracts, transport industry operators face multiple business challenges, including rising operating costs, increased fuel prices, decreasing revenues and tighter margins.</p>
<p>“Scania has always been at the forefront of setting new standards in sustainable logistics solutions,” says Nomonde Kweyi, General Manager, Marketing &amp; Communications, Scania Southern Africa.</p>
<p>“Improving the quality of our products while continuously improving the flows across every part of our supply chain, eliminates waste and allows us to challenge operating costs.”</p>
<p>Scania’s New Truck Generation is setting new benchmarks in the total cost of ownership, providing customers with sustainable cost-efficiencies, and securing them a competitive advantage in their industries.</p>
<p>State-of-the-art technological leadership is behind Scania’s latest sustainable operating breakthrough.</p>
<p>Vehicle data recorded from multiple Scania trucks, in daily operation, using multiple drivers, yielded an average 10% fuel saving across the New Generation truck range.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//responsive/Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//responsive/Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//responsive/Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//responsive/Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//responsive/Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/34//responsive/Scania-truck-in-arid-conditions-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="800" height="534"></figure>
<p>“Every Scania we make is equipped with smart technology, advanced sensors and wireless connectivity," explains Mark Erasmus, General Manager Sales, Scania Southern Africa. </p>
<p>"We have thousands of constantly connected vehicles providing the data needed to make informed cost savings decisions,” he adds.</p>
<p>This proven 10% fuel saving, compared to the Scania PGR range, makes the Scania New Generation the most fuel-efficient truck in South Africa.</p>
<p>“Fuel costs can equate to over a third of operators’ total operating costs,” says Erasmus, “Any improvement in fuel efficiency can provide drastic savings.”</p>
<p>But Scania isn’t resting on their laurels.</p>
<p>“The highest recorded fuel savings in the market provides our customers with the cost-savings needed to offset maintenance costs."</p>
<p>"By using the fuel savings, our customers can pay zero maintenance costs,” explains Erasmus.</p>
<p>Maintaining a truck at zero cost, especially when calculated across a fleet, has the potential to remove significant expenditure from operators’ total running costs, boosting profitability and significantly improving their ability to compete in a highly competitive market.</p>
<p><strong>Watch: </strong>Meet Scania’s next generation of trucks</p>

<p>“Across industries, including freight and logistics, construction, mining and agriculture, we know that maintenance costs absorb much-needed revenue and profit."</p>
<p>"The New Truck Generation has the potential to pay for its own maintenance,” says Erasmus.</p>
<p>It’s total cost of ownership redefined, and Scania South Africa sees it as a game-changer that will help their customers find a sustainable revenue increase while their competitors continue to struggle with high operating costs.</p>
<p>“As challenging economic realities bite, Scania’s sustainable cost-efficiencies are driving our customers business ambitions and delivering increased profitability, that is helping them achieve otherwise elusive business growth,” concludes Erasmus.</p>
