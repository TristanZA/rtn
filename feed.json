How can we now trust the entity – especially when the dishonesty and corruption is allegedly at the highest level in the Agency?</p>\n<p>We already face huge corruption, extortion and intimidation at the hands of traffic police on a daily basis and this latest development has highlighted how rampant dishonesty is in the public service – especially in the traffic law enforcement and management structures.</p>\n<p>These allegations have undermined what little faith we had in RTIA. If the system is implemented, we envisage theft on a grand scale. </p>\n<p>The RFA once again proposes that AARTO be shelved. The continuously amended system is all about generating revenue and not at all about road safety, which was what the system was originally about.</p>\n<p>Huge administrative resources will be required to implement and sustain an antiquated and cumbersome system, putting additional burdens on already-overburdened government authorities and the private sector.<br><br>The <a href=\"https://www.rtmc.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Road Traffic Management Corporation </a>(RTMC) – another Agency of the Department of Transport – already costs motorists hundreds of millions of Rand per annum through the levy imposed on all <a href=\"http://www.enatis.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eNatis </a>transactions.</p>\n<p>This was supposed to be a temporary measure to get the RTMC on its feet. Like all other levies,  this has become permanent with no added value to citizens.</p>\n<p>The RTMC needs to step up and do its job, that is, manage road traffic according to proper traffic management strategies with effective centralised road safety interventions and operational management.<br><br>The RFA believes that proper traffic management strategies which focus resources to address hazardous locations and other aspects of unsafe road behaviour would be far more effective in improving road safety – rather than the current cumbersome AARTO system being proposed.</p>",

The Max Cruise feature sets the most efficient vehicle speed based on road conditions and topography identified using GPS data. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eco Roll is also activated, allowing for optimal acceleration when driving downhill, so that the truck covers the maximum distance with minimum fuel consumption.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Eco+ Mode is switched on, engine power is limited to 450 PS and vehicle speed to 85 kilometres per hour. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If the vehicle idles for longer than five minutes, the engine automatically shuts off to save fuel. This is especially beneficial if the vehicle is left running while waiting at customs or loading.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, the high-performance kickdown feature is deactivated in Eco+ Mode to conserve fuel.

productivity</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using various driveline and chassis configurations, the new Volvo FH can be tailored to suit a wide range of applications and enable significant fuel and CO² savings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In long-haul operations for instance, the new Volvo FH with the updated D13A engine with Torque Assist can deliver fuel savings of up to 3%.*</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volvo Torque Assist is intended to reduce fuel consumption by providing more efficient driving when the cruise control is disabled in long haul operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These innovative functions will help drivers save fuel even when cruise control is not activated.  I-Cruise, Volvo Trucks’ intelligent cruise control, is still the best way to optimise fuel consumption, but sometimes it might not be applicable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volvo Torque Assist is designed to give more fuel-efficient driving by automatically adapting the truck’s torque and acceleration to the road topography, the load and speed changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another supporting function keeps the amount of injected fuel constant after the engine’s ‘green range’ has been passed. The slightly compromised performance is compensated by improved fuel economy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pedal map has also been recalibrated. A less sensitive pedal creates a smoother torque development, which, in turn, makes the truck easier to control. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The software also gives a more significant result with heavy loads, many slope changes or large speed variations, while drivers transporting lighter loads with constant speed on flat roads will save less fuel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many European markets, the Volvo FH is available with the Euro 6 compliant gas-powered LNG engine that offers fuel efficiency and performance on par with that of Volvo’s equivalent diesel trucks, but with a far lower climate impact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gas engine, which is currently being tested in SA</span><strong>,</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can run on either biogas, which cuts CO² by up to 100 percent, or natural gas which reduces CO2 emissions by up to 20 percent when compared with Volvo’s equivalent diesel trucks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This relates to emissions from the vehicle during usage, known as tank to wheel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Productivity, another important customer priority, is further optimised on the Volvo FH due to its capacity for increased front axle loads, as well as tag and pusher axles with improved steering angles to reduce tire wear and improve manoeuvrability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truck is also available with Tandem Axle Lift, enabling the rear axle to be disengaged and raised when the truck is not loaded, reducing the fuel consumption. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/Volvo-FH-series.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-series-xs.jpg 300w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-series-sm.jpg 480w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-series-md.jpg 768w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-series-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-series-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://roadtransport.news/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-series-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"Volvo FH series\" width=\"800\" height=\"436\"></figure>\n<p><span style=\"color: #e50303;\"><strong>Facts about the new Volvo FH </strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabs: Low sleeper cab, Sleeper cab, Globetrotter cab and Globetrotter XL. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exterior and interior trim packages for individual design. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diesel engines are available with different emissions standards. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The D13A Euro 3 engine is available with 400 hp/ 2200Nm, 480 hp/ 2400 Nm and 520 hp/ 2500 Nm.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Euro 5 variant available in South Africa on request.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Gear changing system: I-Shift with software packages for different areas of application. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Drivers can now drive with more confidence, as the FH offers a multitude of enhancements,” said Hörberg. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As long-haul drivers spend so much of their time on the road, we focussed on their comfort, safety and efficiency.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe the new FH delivers on all of that, and more.”</span></p>\n<p><em>*The fuel improvement claim is calculated by comparing costs of diesel D13A Euro 3 with Torque Assist to D13A Euro 3 without Torque Assist.  Actual fuel economy may vary depending on many factors such as the driver’s experience, use of cruise control, vehicle specification, vehicle load, actual topography, vehicle maintenance and weather conditions.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Now read:</strong> <a href=\"https://roadtransport.news/volvo-trucks-in-biggest-ever-launch/\">Volvo Trucks In Biggest Ever Launch</a></p>",
