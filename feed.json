levels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The low rpm also reduces CO₂ emissions, while the trucks’ Eco Performance Mode ensures an optimal balance between high drivability and best fuel efficiency. </span></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gavin says local tests carried out on the new DAF trucks in South Africa have shown an average 10% reduction in fuel costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This means significant savings for long distance operators where up to 60% of overall expenses are allocated to fuel consumption,” comments Gavin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He adds that operators can also expect to see a reduction in maintenance costs on the new DAF CF and XF trucks, thanks

Accurate, historical stats can provide insights into the frequency and severity of windscreen claims.</p>\n<p>Armed with these insights, a simple calculation is all it takes to determine whether the sum of premiums and excesses are more or less than the cost of paying for the replacements out of your own funds.</p>\n<p>By self-insuring windscreens, fleet operators will be motivated to negotiate the best deals from windscreen suppliers, thereby bringing down the average cost of repair.</p>\n<p>Fleet operators will also take risk mitigation actions, such as ensuring that all rules are followed according to the fleet vehicle policy, to minimise the occurrence of these incidents.</p>\n<p>The bigger one’s fleet, the more financial sense it makes to self-insure against windscreen losses.</p>\n<p><strong>Now read:</strong> <a href=\"https://roadtransport.news/four-causes-of-truck-rollovers/\">The Four Causes of Truck Rollovers</a></p>",

Many also opt to use paper systems rather than electronic solutions.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Infrastructure is another challenge we have as it is entirely inadequate for the traffic volumes. It is badly outdated and archaic in design. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Truck-weighing processes are cumbersome and slow, while corruption is rife.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Excessive charges worsen the situation and are slowly killing regional trade in the Southern African Development Community (SADC).</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cross border permits serve no purpose and are nothing but another revenue collection tool, while there are a host of unnecessary permits, levies, taxes, and fees to be paid.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Watch:</strong> Trucks queue at the Chirundu Border Post</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZvb5VamHcw\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Chirundu border post between Zambia and Zimbabwe is currently the only One-Stop Border Post (OSBP) in Southern Africa. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But, it is not functioning well by all accounts because it faces the same challenges as the traditional border posts - high staff turnover, inadequate infrastructure, and poorly integrated customs systems.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To bring about any change, we need total commitment and cooperation between heads of states. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Whether governments choose to implement OSBPs or smart borders, we need this done rapidly.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Infrastructure at border posts must also be upgraded to accommodate current and future traffic volumes.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Furthermore, there has to be a reduction in the number of weigh-bridge stations and police checkpoints along the transport corridors. Cross-border permits need scrapping.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The introduction of a yellow card or alternative insurance system recognised by all members and purchased in the country of origin would also improve the situation.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Just as important is introducing one cross-border charge or fee applicable in all member states.</span></p>",

This emphasises the importance of being aware of risk factors and what is required to ensure that you eliminate all the risks you can.</p>\n<p>“MasterDrive’s rollover prevention training teaches drivers about risk factors and provides guidance on how to avoid falling victim to one.\"</p>\n<p>\"Importantly, the unique engineering of the truck allows drivers to feel what an actual rollover feels like without going all the way over.</p>\n<p>\"It is an invaluable opportunity to understand a rollover without the financial implications,” says Herbert.</p>\n<p><strong>Now read:</strong> <a href=\"https://roadtransport.news/insurance-and-driver-training-intertwined/\">Insurance and driver training intertwined</a></p>",
