Interactions that require the driver’s attention are now concentrated on the side display, which is placed within easy reach of the driver’s seat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Distractions are therefore minimised as key driving information is shown clearly on the user-friendly and easily-viewable instrument display.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving inside the cabin is easier than ever with the new slimmer, ergonomically designed I-Shift gear selector.

productivity</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using various driveline and chassis configurations, the new Volvo FH can be tailored to suit a wide range of applications and enable significant fuel and CO² savings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In long-haul operations for instance, the new Volvo FH with the updated D13A engine with Torque Assist can deliver fuel savings of up to 3%.*</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volvo Torque Assist is intended to reduce fuel consumption by providing more efficient driving when the cruise control is disabled in long haul operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These innovative functions will help drivers save fuel even when cruise control is not activated.  I-Cruise, Volvo Trucks’ intelligent cruise control, is still the best way to optimise fuel consumption, but sometimes it might not be applicable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volvo Torque Assist is designed to give more fuel-efficient driving by automatically adapting the truck’s torque and acceleration to the road topography, the load and speed changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another supporting function keeps the amount of injected fuel constant after the engine’s ‘green range’ has been passed. The slightly compromised performance is compensated by improved fuel economy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pedal map has also been recalibrated. A less sensitive pedal creates a smoother torque development, which, in turn, makes the truck easier to control. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The software also gives a more significant result with heavy loads, many slope changes or large speed variations, while drivers transporting lighter loads with constant speed on flat roads will save less fuel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many European markets, the Volvo FH is available with the Euro 6 compliant gas-powered LNG engine that offers fuel efficiency and performance on par with that of Volvo’s equivalent diesel trucks, but with a far lower climate impact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gas engine, which is currently being tested in SA</span><strong>,</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can run on either biogas, which cuts CO² by up to 100 percent, or natural gas which reduces CO2 emissions by up to 20 percent when compared with Volvo’s equivalent diesel trucks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This relates to emissions from the vehicle during usage, known as tank to wheel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Productivity, another important customer priority, is further optimised on the Volvo FH due to its capacity for increased front axle loads, as well as tag and pusher axles with improved steering angles to reduce tire wear and improve manoeuvrability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truck is also available with Tandem Axle Lift, enabling the rear axle to be disengaged and raised when the truck is not loaded, reducing the fuel consumption. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://tristanza.github.io/rtn/media/posts/7/Volvo-FH-series.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://tristanza.github.io/rtn/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-series-xs.jpg 300w ,https://tristanza.github.io/rtn/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-series-sm.jpg 480w ,https://tristanza.github.io/rtn/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-series-md.jpg 768w ,https://tristanza.github.io/rtn/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-series-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://tristanza.github.io/rtn/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-series-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://tristanza.github.io/rtn/media/posts/7/responsive/Volvo-FH-series-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"Volvo FH series\" width=\"800\" height=\"436\"></figure>\n<p><span style=\"color: #e50303;\"><strong>Facts about the new Volvo FH </strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabs: Low sleeper cab, Sleeper cab, Globetrotter cab and Globetrotter XL. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exterior and interior trim packages for individual design. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diesel engines are available with different emissions standards. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The D13A Euro 3 engine is available with 400 hp/ 2200Nm, 480 hp/ 2400 Nm and 520 hp/ 2500 Nm.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Euro 5 variant available in South Africa on request.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Gear changing system: I-Shift with software packages for different areas of application. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Drivers can now drive with more confidence, as the FH offers a multitude of enhancements,” said Hörberg. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As long-haul drivers spend so much of their time on the road, we focussed on their comfort, safety and efficiency.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe the new FH delivers on all of that, and more.”</span></p>\n<p><em>*The fuel improvement claim is calculated by comparing costs of diesel D13A Euro 3 with Torque Assist to D13A Euro 3 without Torque Assist.  Actual fuel economy may vary depending on many factors such as the driver’s experience, use of cruise control, vehicle specification, vehicle load, actual topography, vehicle maintenance and weather conditions.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Now read:</strong> <a href=\"https://tristanza.github.io/rtn/volvo-trucks-in-biggest-ever-launch/\">Volvo Trucks In Biggest Ever Launch</a></p>",

changed significantly during the past year, and so has the way we live our lives and run our businesses,” says Filip Van den Heede, managing director of UD Trucks Southern Africa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While adhering to government regulations, we also understand that there is a need to continue with economic activities, and that is why we are more committed than ever to support the logistics industry in the country.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said the company commends the strong resilience of the local transport industry that supported the good recovery of the market in 2020 after the hard lockdown.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe this challenging spirit will continue into 2021, as we remain positive about the future and committed to support logistics in our region,” stated Van den Heede.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #e50303;\"><strong>New Additions to Croner Range </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its launch in 2017, UD Trucks’ Croner range originally operated only in the Heavy Commercial Vehicle (HCV) segment.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through UD Trucks’ expansion programme, the new Croner truck-tractor will be classified as an Extra Heavy Commercial Vehicle, operating in the up to 350hp lightweight truck-tractor segment.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new LKE 15-tonne freight carrier will operate in the 8-tonne payload segment in the HCV segment. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://tristanza.github.io/rtn/media/posts/5/Croner-4x2-PKE280-truck-tractor-a-_1_.webp\" alt=\"UD Trucks' Croner distribution truck\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\"></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rory Schulz, UD Trucks Southern Africa’s marketing and sales director, says the company is expanding its Croner range to improve their offering in urban and inter-city distribution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the very competitive 8-to-9-tonne payload segment, we saw the need arise for a fuel efficient, high payload unit with good drivability at good value for money.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With the new model introductions, we are improving payload, fuel efficiency and adding more driver comfort, as well as extending service intervals,” adds Schulz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With UD Trucks Telematics Services as standard and a region wide dealer network, fleet owners are supported no matter where they operate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Croner LKE 210 freight carrier boasts a GH5, 5-litre engine and an Allison 2500 series automatic transmission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With 850 Nm of torque along with a good transmission ratio ensure the truck can quickly get to the 60km/h mark in city, or to the 80km/h where the law allows. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The LKE 210 has a low tare mass and optimised wheelbase of 5 500mm for both volume and mass payloads.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this combines to provide a truck with class-leading payload productivity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Allison automatic transmissions ease the job at hand for drivers who spend the day in the urban environment, facing long hours of traffic with multiple stops and cargo drops,” explains Schulz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The new generation torque converter with early lock-up also ensures a smooth and easy drive so driver fatigue is reduced, which means the driver can concentrate on situational driving.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Additionally, the enhanced power shifts lead to more efficient fuel consumption, comfort, manoeuvrability and performance.”</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://tristanza.github.io/rtn/media/posts/5/automatic-transmissions.webp\" alt=\"UD

automatic transmission series, with similar emphasis on urban and city-to-city distribution, as well as focus on inter-regional haul.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2020, UD Trucks also introduced a Croner 6x2 PDE280 freight carrier, which brings the total of variants in this range to 16 models.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The work a vehicle does, and the resources required to do it, are essential to the success of any fleet,” continues Schulz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Productivity to us means how much payload you can carry, at the highest possible legal speed, with as little fuel as possible. And the Croner certainly delivers on all these factors in a smart and modern way, day in and day out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UD Trucks’ Croner range is assembled at its plant in Rosslyn, Gauteng, according to the company’s global quality standards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we originally launched the Croner range, we wanted to offer fleet owners trucks and solutions that maximise uptime and productivity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These new additions to the Corner family are no exception,” said Van den Heede.  “We know how important it is to make every moment count in the transport business.”</span></p>",
