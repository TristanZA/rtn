Many also opt to use paper systems rather than electronic solutions.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Infrastructure is another challenge we have as it is entirely inadequate for the traffic volumes.

Cross-border permits need scrapping.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The introduction of a yellow card or alternative insurance system recognised by all members and purchased in the country of origin would also improve the situation.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Just as important is introducing one cross-border charge or fee applicable in all member states.</span></p>",

This emphasises the importance of being aware of risk factors and what is required to ensure that you eliminate all the risks you can.</p>\n<p>“MasterDrive’s rollover prevention training teaches drivers about risk factors and provides guidance on how to avoid falling victim to one.\"</p>\n<p>\"Importantly, the unique engineering of the truck allows drivers to feel what an actual rollover feels like without going all the way over.</p>\n<p>\"It is an invaluable opportunity to understand a rollover without the financial implications,” says Herbert.</p>\n<p><strong>Now read:</strong> <a href=\"https://roadtransport.news/insurance-and-driver-training-intertwined/\">Insurance and driver training intertwined</a></p>",
