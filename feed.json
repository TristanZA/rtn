Many organisations are looking to reduce the expenses on cargo security. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">With South Africa’s soaring crime rate, this approach could have dangerous and unintended consequences. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">As a result, service provider Rhenus Logistics South Africa is constantly looking at ways to minimise threats and ensure the integrity of its customers’ shipments, whilst reducing costs.</span></p>\n<p>The number of reported truck hijackings in South Africa has escalated over the past year by an alarming 32 percent. According to Statista Research Department, 1,202 truck hijackings occurred between April 2019 and March 2020, often ending with violent attacks on drivers.</p>\n<p>With the sharp increase in online shopping as a result of COVID-19, courier vehicles are now increasingly being targeted too. Heightened activity by organised syndicates, as well as opportunistic incidents, are a reality. </p>\n<p>“Criminals have become much more brazen in their approach. The industry is now experiencing far more orchestrated heists, with groups of up to 25 robbers going after one delivery vehicle,” says Martin Taylor, Risk Manager at Rhenus Logistics South Africa, in a recent interview with television programme Carte Blanche.</p>\n<p>“It has become a strategy of ‘shoot first, steal later’, which means that cargo drivers are now more at risk than ever. Although high-value goods are most sought-after, all cargo is at risk, which means that all deliveries are vulnerable.”</p>\n<p><strong>Watch:</strong> Steals on wheels | Carte Blanche | Mnet</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dExO_umdHrY?t=386s\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Rhenus Logistics South Africa follows state-of-the-art security protocols, including ongoing anti-hijacking training for drivers, as well as vehicle tracking and on-board video surveillance that is monitored 24/7 by highly trained control room personnel.</p>\n<p>“Cargo crime is not only going to continue, but will increase,” emphasises Taylor.</p>\n<p>“Law enforcement bodies, including the crime intelligence unit of the South African Police Service, have expanded their operations and are doing what they can, but they don’t have the capacity to fight crime by themselves.</p>\n<p>\"It needs to be a collective effort involving all stakeholders, including the public. The logistics and security industries are collaborating and sharing information and resources in efforts to combat ongoing crime.”</p>\n<p>In a financially constrained environment, it is understandable that importers will look for various ways to reduce costs and the temptation to cut on security can be great.</p>\n<p>According to Rob Stead, Chief Operating Officer at Rhenus Logistics South Africa, the cost of security in the supply chain can be as much as 11 percent of the value of goods.</p>\n<p>Stead goes on to highlight the consequences of inadequate security. “Theft results in lost sales, but also has the potential for reputational damage, should an importer‘s brand be associated with a public incident.</p>\n<p>And of course, our biggest concern is for the safety of staff members and the public that needs to be ensured at all times.” In Stead’s opinion, it is important for cargo owners to carefully consider areas of risk mitigation, to optimise these expenses.</p>\n<p>“Security awareness and agile, proactive risk management are essential. Importers needing to have their goods transported should partner with companies that have highly-developed security protocols and systems in place, such as 24/7 camera surveillance,” Stead explains.</p>\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null\">Webfleet Solutions, Lytx Create Video-based Solution</a></p>\n<p>“This will minimise risk and help them build more secure and resilient supply chains.” The key to successful risk management is vigilance and agility in adapting cargo handling processes.</p>\n<p>“With our many years of experience and our global footprint, we are well-equipped to stay one step ahead in the fight against crime.</p>\n<p>\"It’s an ongoing process as syndicates become more and more sophisticated – so we need to constantly evaluate developments and stay ahead of the criminals,” concludes Stead.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>Long before the Covid-19 pandemic changed the business environment as we know it, JAC Motors' X200 forward-cab light commercial vehicle (LCV) was already a popular choice among business owners worldwide.</strong></p>\n<p>With Covid-19 fuelling the online industry and demand for delivery services, entrepreneurs involved in distributing products are constantly searching for more affordable and effective fleet solutions to deliver on their customers' expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://roadtransport.news/telematics-supports-e-commerce-growth/\">Telematics Supports E-commerce Growth</a></p>\n<p>Reliability, low running cost and versatility are critical elements in managing any fleet, and it is in these departments where the X200 impresses its owners and drivers.</p>\n<p>The X200 was developed to excel in the harshest working conditions. Although it is a versatile workhorse, it comes standard with features such as air-conditioning and crumple zones to create a safe and comfortable work environment for the driver and passengers.</p>\n<p>Companies supplying services like catering hire, furniture deliveries, truck hire, garden services, contractors, electricians, plumbers and many other types of small businesses are using the versatile X200.</p>\n<p>\"Currently, everyone is trying to find ways to do more with less due to economic pressures,\" says Karl-Heinz Göbel, CEO of JAC Motors South Africa.</p>\n<p>\"Our affordable X200 bakkie is the best workhorse choice in the local market, as it outclasses direct competitors in the price, performance, load configuration and comfort categories.\"</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #e50303;\"><strong>Compact and manoeuvrable workhorse to go where big trucks cannot</strong></span></p>\n<p>It is essential in the commercial vehicle sector that an LCV's design caters for various customer groups. A forward-cab design's main benefit is the increased load box size with a much larger load volume. A forward-cab design is more practical than a standard bakkie, making these rugged workhorses ideal for business and industrial use.</p>\n<p>The X200's compact size and minimum turning radius of 5.4 metres ensure easy manoeuvrability in places where larger trucks cannot navigate. The optimal ride height and ultra-flat low deck of the X200, with its dropsides, make loading and unloading easy and fast.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch:</strong> JAC X200 - A perfect mini-truck for your business</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jBAn4GUr9kA\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>A forward-cab design also incorporates other advantages that both drivers and fleet owners appreciate, such as the easy entrance and exit for drivers and crew in many load-stop-and-drop situations.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #e50303;\"><strong>Reliable 2.8-litre turbo-diesel engine for harsh working conditions</strong></span></p>\n<p>The X200 supports a proven 2.8-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine mounted under the front seats. This reliable engine produces 80 kW at 3 600 r/min and 240 Nm of torque between 1 800 and 2 000 r/min.</p>\n<p>A trademark of the X200's powertrain design is fuel economy. The power is distributed via a 5-speed transmission to the rear wheels.</p>\n<p>The maximum torque available at low rpm allows drivers to minimise gear changes and reduce fuel usage. The average fuel consumption of the X200 is 9.5 ℓ/100 km (combined cycle).</p>\n<p>\"The X200 boasts the ideal engine capacity for our country's demanding conditions. The durable 2.8-litre turbo-diesel engine produces more than 30% power than its direct competitors, resulting in outstanding functionality and everyday utility in urban and regional operations,\" says Göbel.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #e50303;\"><strong>Robust chassis design for demanding working conditions</strong></span></p>\n<p>The X200 supports JAC Motors' new chassis stamping and welding treatment process, developed for the heavy-duty ladder-frame chassis used in their N-Series truck range. The main benefit of a solid ladder-frame chassis is the optimum axle weight distribution that enhances safety.</p>\n<p>The X200's double-wishbone independent front suspension and robust ladder-frame chassis design allow for excellent manoeuvrability and solid handling regardless of how much payload it is carrying.</p>\n<p>Large disc brakes in front supported by drum brakes at the back and a Load Sensing Proportioning Valve (LSPV) deliver excellent stopping power.</p>\n<p>The hydraulic assisted power steering provides excellent handling, optimised manoeuvrability and safe driving characteristics in all load states and on any road surface.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #e50303;\"><strong>Large payload to easily transport heavy loads</strong></span></p>\n<p>With a maximum permitted payload of 1 500 kg, a large load area of 4 595 mm², the X200 offers practical solutions for everyday use that will meet customer expectations for any transport task at hand.</p>\n<p>The length of the X200's load box almost measures 2.8 metres. Space is optimally designed for working conditions with a lower deck height of just 785 mm. With standard dropside configuration, the X200 is ready to meet the modern-day demands of cargo transport.</p>\n<p>The maximum use of axle capacities for ideal payload weight distribution ensures optimal manoeuvrability in heavy urban traffic and on open roads. The X200 can tow a braked trailer of up to 1 250 kg.</p>\n<p>\"The no-nonsense work attitude of the X200 explains why it is such a favourite with business owners worldwide. Its powerful engine, balanced transmission and excellent payload creates confidence whatever or wherever the haul is,\" adds Göbel.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #e50303;\"><strong>An ergonomic driver's workplace</strong></span></p>\n<p>The X200 offers an elevated driving position. The results are that the driver can see and judge traffic better on the open roads, and it further improves visibility when parking at load bays.</p>\n<p>Front- and rear crumple zones, side-impact protection beams, height-adjustable headlamps and an immobiliser further add to occupants' safety.</p>\n<p>Remote-controlled central locking with motion-lock at 40 km/h and an engine that cannot ignite when the clutch is not engaged further contribute to the safety credentials of the X200.</p>\n<p>An air-conditioned cab with comfortable cloth seats with headrests, and a height-adjustable steering wheel, make for pleasant travelling for both the driver and passengers.</p>\n<p>The centre seat's backrest folds down, offering ample stowing space. The X200 comes standard with a Radio/CD/MP3 player and speakers fitted in the front doors.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #e50303;\"><strong>Model line-up and pricing</strong></span></p>\n<p>With the most competitive pricing in its class, the X200 offers excellent value for money to get your business going.</p>\n<p>Priced from R284 900, the X200 comes standard with a five-year/150 000-kilometre manufacturer warranty, including a five-year/60 000-kilometre service plan. Service intervals are scheduled for every 10 000 km.</p>\n<p>The JAC X200 2.8-litre TDi 1.5-tonne range comprises three derivatives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>X200 Chassis Cab – R284 900</li>\n<li>X200 Dropside – R294 900</li>\n<li>X200 Tipper – R324 900</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The X200 is also available in double-cab configuration and retails at R304 900. Fitted with the same 2.8-litre TDi engine and a payload of 1.3-tonne, the double-cab is especially popular with operators who need to transport more than three workers.</p>\n<p>The double-cab can transport six people inside the cab. According to the local traffic regulations, it is illegal to transport people on the back of a bakkie on public roads.</p>\n<p>\"Our reliable and versatile X200 range meets our ever-increasing customer expectations and tick all the right boxes to be the star performer in any transport fleet,\" concludes Göbel.</p>\n<p><strong>Now Read: <a href=\"https://roadtransport.news/jac-motors-continues-to-grow/\">JAC Motors Continues To Grow</a></strong></p>",
